\section{Calibration methods for \bjet\ and light jet}
\large
MC simulations are not able to model exactly the 
performance of the $b$-tagging algorithms in data. For this reason 
calibration is required, i.e.\ correcting MC to recover the data 
in terms of $b$-tagging efficiency, charm jet mis-tagging and 
light jet mis-tagging rates~\cite{FTAG-2018-01}. The calibration is performed 
for all supported jet collections(TODO: refer back to the object definition chapter)
and working points, which are cuts in the \btagging\ 
algorithm output identifying the different tagging efficiencies 
and corresponding light jet and \cjet rejection rate.
In general, the efficiency is calculated with data and simulations, 
and scale factors are then calculated to match the efficiency extracted 
from simulations to the data.
% The imperfect 
% description of the detector response and physics modelling effects 
% in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations necessitates the measurement of the 
% performance of the \btagging\ algorithms with collision data 
%~\cite{PERF-2012-04,ATLAS-CONF-2018-045}. 
% The measurement of the \bjet\ tagging efficiency 
% of the high-level \btagging\ algorithms used in protonâ€“proton (pp) 
% collision data recorded during Run 2 of the LHC at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV 
% is presented. 
% The corresponding measurements for \cjets\ and light-flavour 
% jets, used in the measurement of the \bjet\ tagging efficiency to correct 
% the simulation such that the overall tagging efficiency of \cjets\ and 
% light-flavour jets match that of the data, are described elsewhere 
%~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-006},~\cite{cjet}. 
The production of $t\bar{t}$ 
pairs at the LHC provides an abundant source of \bjets by virtue 
of the high cross-section and the $t \rightarrow Wb$ branching ratio 
being close to 100\%. A very pure sample of $t\bar{t}$ events can be 
selected by requiring that both $W$ bosons decay leptonically, 
referred to as di-leptonic $t\bar{t}$ decays in the following.
For the \bjet\ calibration, the performance of the $b$ tagging 
algorithms is evaluated in the simulation and the efficiency 
with which these algorithms identify jets containing $b$-hadrons 
is measured in collision data. The measurement uses a likelihood-based 
method in the di-leptonic $t\bar{t}$ sample, where
events with exactly 2 jets and 2 opposite-sign leptons are selected.  
The data \bjet\ efficiency is 
then extracted from a combined likelihood fit, and subsequently 
compared with that predicted by the simulation. Scale factors are 
then calculated to emulate the performance of the algorithms to the data~\cite{FTAG-2018-01}.

For the light jet mis-tagging calibration, two methods are 
used to measure the mis-tagging rate from the data~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-006}. 
The first is the negative tag method, which uses a high statistics data sample enriched 
in light jets with the application of a modified algorithm which 
reverses some of the criteria used in the nominal identification 
algorithm.
The second is the adjusted Monte Carlo (adjusted-MC) method, which 
adjusts the characteristic track observables in the simulation 
to im the data, and then compares the adjusted simulation to the 
``standard'' simulation. The scale factors are then calculated using 
the these two methods. The scale factors of the two different methods 
are in good agreement within the systematic uncertainties. 
%The aim of this calibration is to calibrate \bjets that have been mis-tagged as light jets of \btagging\ algorithm. As the $b$-tagging algorithm is very efficient in rejecting light jets, the light jet fraction is enriched via ``flipped'' taggers, which negates the sign of track IP parameters before $b$-tagging\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-006}. The calibrations of the standard and the 'flipped' tagger are assumed to be equal. The calibration is extracted using the leading $p_T$ jet of Z+jets events using a 2D fit. TODO: cite the light jet tagging Int note
%light jet fractions in the $b$-like region are too low,  The Z + jets events are then selected, the secondary vertex mass is fitted to obtain flavour fractions and perform a likelihood fit to extract light jet mistag rate.
\section{Calibration method for \cjet}
\label{sec:Calibration method for charm jet}
It is worth mentioning that the author's qualification task to become an ATLAS author is to 
calibrate the rate of a charm jet being mis-identified as a \bjet\, which is a part 
of the calibration of the $b$-tagging algorithm.
During the task the calibration range has been extended down to 20~GeV (previously 25~GeV) in
jet \pt\ and a new selection category has been developed 
to increase the data statistics of the scale factors in the 
high-$p_T$ ($p_T^{jet}$ > 70~GeV) region.
The calibration is performed on the PFlow jets (as defined in Section~\label{sec:jet})
and \textit{VR-Track jets} reconstructed using the variable radius jet algorithm~\cite{VRTrackJet}.

As determined by the CKM matrix~\cite{CKM1,CKM2}, the $W$ boson decays dominantly to 
a pair of light quarks ($u$ quark and $d$ quark) or to
a $s$ quark and a \cquark. The $W$ boson decays very rarely to pairs containing a \bquark. 
More specifically, the branching ratio of a $W$ boson decays to a $u$ quark and $d$ quark pair or 
a $s$ quark and $c$ quark pair is 33.1\%, and to pairs containing a $b$ quark is only 0.057\%~\cite{PDG}. 
Therefore, $b$-tagged jets from the $W$ decay are most likely 
to be mis-tagged \cjets or light jets. 

Furthermore, given the ratio between the DL1 light jet rejection and the corresponding charm jet rejection 
ranges from 10 to 40 (Figure~\ref{fig:b-tagging-performance}), the 
\cjet\ is much more likely to be mis-tagged than the light jet. 
This allows for a source of mis-tagged \cjets to be obtained in the \ttbar\ events, 
requiring that one $W$ boson decays leptonically and the other decay hadronically 
(referred to as semi-leptonic $t\bar{t}$ decay in the following),
where the $b$-tagged jets from the $W$ decay are candidates of mis-tagged \cjets.
Requiring a $W$ boson decaying leptonically 
reduces the number of combinations of jets of different flavour, 
and allows triggering with the lepton.

The events kinematics are shown by the diagram in 
Figure~\ref{fig:feynman}, where the \ttbar\ pair decays to a 
$b$ and a $\bar{b}$ quark, circled in red. One of the $W$ bosons, 
circled in blue, decays hadronically to quarks, 
and the other $W$ boson decays leptonically to either 
an electron or a muon and the corresponding neutrinos, 
circled in green and purple, respectively. 
The lepton in the final state is used for triggering.
The following notation will be used: the jets that are
the decay products of the $W$ boson are referred to as
$W$ jets and the remaining two jets are referred to as top-jets.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{FTAG_plots/feynman.png}
\caption{Feynman diagram of the semi-leptonic $t\bar{t}$ events.}
\label{fig:feynman}
\end{figure}

%As Shown in Fig \ref{fig:feynman}, the calibration uses the semi-leptonic $t\bar{t}$ events, which one $W$ boson from top decays leptonically to a charged lepton and neutrino and one $W$ decays hadronically and dominantly to a charm and a strange quark, among other pairs.

A kinematic likelihood technique, referred to as 
KLFitter~\cite{ERDMANN201418}, is used to assign jets to the proper $t\bar{t}$ decay product 
(more details in Section \ref{KLFitter}). 
The following notation will be used: the jets that are
assigned as the decay products of the $W$ boson are referred to as
$W$ jets and the remaining two jets are referred to as top jets.


The charm jet efficiency is defined as the ratio of events with either of the 
\wjet\ is tagged. The efficiency is evaluated in four \pt\ intervals, with 
boundaries of 20, 40, 65, 140 and 250~GeV for the PFlow jets and 15, 20, 40, 140~GeV
for the VR-Track jets; and for four tagging intervals with the boundaries of 85\%, 77\%,
70\% and 60\%. 

The choice of the bin boundaries ensures enough statistics for each bin and 
hence relatively flat statistical uncertainty, 
given the underlying charm-jet \pt\ spectrum as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kinematic_distributions_combined}.
The boundaries for the VR-Track jets are lower than for PFlow jets, 
since the track jets miss the neutral particles the
reconstructed energy is significantly below the true jet energy.

The main method described in the chapter is for the ``fixed-cut'' calibration
where the efficiency is defined as the fraction of \bjets passing the tagger.
Jets are said to be tagged (untagged) at particular working point
if they have DL1r scores greater (less) than the DL1r score of that working point.
The events with both \wjet\ are discarded to simplfiy the fit described in the following.

To extract the scale factors of the charm jet mis-tagging, a fit is performed by minimising 
the $\chi^2$ defined as:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\chi^2 = \sum_{t=1}^4 \sum_{i=1}^4  \sum_{j=1}^4 (N^{t}_{\mathrm{data}}(i,j)- p(i,j) [c^{t}(i)N^{t}_{C}(i,j)+N^{t}_{J}(i,j)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
	+ \sum_k  c^{4}(k) N^{t}_{X}(i,j,k)])^2/N^{t}_{\mathrm{data}}(i,j)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray}
 +  \sum_{i=1}^4 \sum_{j=i}^4 [N^{\mathrm{untag}}_{\mathrm{data}}(i,j)-p(i,j)N^{\mathrm{untag}}_{\mathrm{MC}}(i,j)]^2/N^{\mathrm{untag}}_{\mathrm{data}}(i,j).
\label{eqn:chi2}
\end{eqnarray}
The $c^{t}(i)$ is the main floating parameter in the fit, which is the charm jet 
mis-tagging scale factor at working point $t$ of \pt\ bin labelled $i$. 
The other main floating parameter is $p(i,j)$ that is the normalisation factor scaling the MC to
data. 
The $N^{t}_{\mathrm{data}}(i,j)$ is the number of data events with a tagged \wjet\ in the \pt\ bin labelled i
and the other (untagged) \wjet\ in the \pt\ bin labelled j. Similarly the $N^{t}_{C}(i,j)$ is the number of MC events 
with a tagged \wjet\, while the tagged \wjet\ is indeed a \cjet\, which can be seen as ``signal''. 
In contrast the $N^{t}_{J}(i,j)$ is the number of events with neither the tagged \wjet\ nor the top jets 
are \cjets\; and the $N^{t}_{X}(i,j,k)$ is the number of events with one of the top jets is a \cjet\. 
These two types of events can be seen as ``background''. The later case is slightly more complicated, as the 
\cjet\ lies in a different \pt\ bin to the tagged jet, denoted as $k$, and it only depends on the 
$c^4(k)$ (which is the scale factor of the 4th working point i.e. 60\% ) as the top jets
are tagged at 60\% working point. 
The calibration is then given as the scale factors of the four working points 
in bins of \pt\ defined in the above text. 

% The charm-jet efficiency of the MC can be extracted from the truth information which indicates the 
% true nature of the $W$ jets. The \cjet\ efficiency of the MC is defined as the probability a true \cjet\ 
% is tagged by the \btagging\ algorithm in bins of jet \pt. 
% The charm-jet efficiency of the data is extracted by applying a combinatorial likelihood fit to $W$ jets, 
% where the main floating parameter are the \cjet\ efficiency
% in a given \pt\ bin and the ratio of data over total MC. 
% The calibration is given as scale factors in bins of \pt\ for 4 fixed-cut working points (WP) 
% that scale the simulation shape to reproduce that of the data, where the
% scale factors are calculated as the ratio of the data charm-jet efficiency over 
% the MC charm-jet efficiency. The calibration is performed for 4 \pt\ bins  
% (20, 40, 65, 140, 250) for the PFLow jets and (10, 20, 40, 65, 140) for the VR-Track jets
% in units of GeV. 

\section{Data and Monte Carlo samples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:samples}
TODO: remove the overlap between this section and the Data MC chapter in the thesis
Dedicated MC are used to model SM processes. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The data analysed in this study correspond to 139~fb$^{-1}$~\cite{DAPR-2010-01,DAPR-2011-01,DAPR-2013-01,LUCID2}, 
of \(pp\) collision data collected by the ATLAS detector between 2015 and 2018
with a centre-of-mass energy of 13~\TeV. 
The data sample was collected using a set of single-muon~\cite{Aad:2020uyd} 
and single-electron triggers~\cite{TRIG-2018-05}. The single-muon triggers 
had \pt\ thresholds in the range 20--26~\GeV\ for 
isolated muons and 50~\GeV\ for muons without any isolation requirement. 
The single-electron triggers employed a range of \pt\ thresholds 
varying between 24--300~\GeV\ 
and a combination of quality and isolation requirements depending on the 
data-taking period and the \pt\ threshold.
%The uncertainty in the combined 2015--2018
%integrated luminosity is 1.7\%~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-021}, obtained
%using the LUCID-2 detector~\cite{LUCID2} for the primary luminosity
%measurements. 
All detector subsystems were required to be operational
during data taking and to fulfil data quality requirements.  

% The $t\bar{t}$ samples and the single top-quark in the Wt 
% and s-channel samples are generated with the {\tt Powheg-Box} v2~\cite{powheg} 
% generator. Electroweak t-channel single top-quark events are generated 
% using the {\tt Powheg-Box} v1~generator. The parton shower, fragmentation, 
% and the underlying event are simulated using {\tt Pythia} 6.428\cite{pythia} 
% with the CTEQ6L1 PDF sets and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune (P2012)~\cite{perugia}. 
% The top-quark mass is set to 172.5~GeV. The {\tt EvtGen} v1.2.0 program~\cite{evtgen} 
% is used to model the properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays. 
% The $t\bar{t}$ production cross-section is calculated at NNLO+NNLL 
% (next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm)~\cite{NNLO}. For single-top processes, 
% the generator NLO cross-sections are used. Events containing $W$ or $Z$ 
% bosons with associated jets are simulated using {\tt Sherpa} 2.2.1\cite{sherpa}. 
% All $W$/$Z$+jets events are normalised to the predicted cross-sections using 
% NNLO calculations. All samples are passed through the full GEANT4\cite{GEANT4} 
% simulation of the ATLAS detector and are reconstructed with the same software as used for data.



All samples were 
produced using the ATLAS simulation infrastructure~\cite{SOFT-2010-01}
and $\GEANT4$~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}. A subset of samples use a faster 
simulation based on a parameterisation of the calorimeter response and 
$\GEANT4$ for the other detector systems~\cite{SOFT-2010-01}. %\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2010-013}.
The simulated events are reconstructed with the same algorithms as
used for data, and contain a realistic modelling of pile-up
interactions. The pile-up profiles in the simulation match those of each dataset
between 2015 and 2018, and are obtained by overlaying minimum-bias events,
simulated using the soft QCD processes of
{\PYTHIA}~8~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} using the NNPDF2.3LO set of
PDFs~\cite{Ball:2012cx} and a set of tuned
parameters called the A3 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-017}.

The events that are used in this study originate mostly due to 
\ttbar\ production. This process is modelled using the
\powhegbox~v2~\cite{Frixione:2007nw,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
generator at NLO with the \nnpdfnlo % ~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}
parton distribution function (PDF) set
and the \hdamp\ parameter\footnote{The
  \hdamp\ parameter is a resummation damping factor and one of the
  parameters that controls the matching of \powheg matrix elements to
  the parton shower and thus effectively regulates the
  high-\pt\ radiation against which the \ttbar\ system recoils.} set
to 1.5~\mtop~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-020}.  The events were interfaced
to {\PYTHIA}~8.230 to model the parton shower,
hadronisation, and underlying event, with parameters set according
to the A14 tune and using the \nnpdftwo set of PDFs.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were performed by \evtgen~v1.6.0~\cite{EvtGen}.
 The simulated \ttbar\
events are split according to the origin of $W$ jets. The notation
``\ttbar, ll'' denotes that both $W$ jets are light flavour jets.
Similarly, ``\ttbar, cl'' (``\ttbar, bl'') 
indicates that one of the $W$ jets is a \cjet\ (\bjet)
whereas the other is a light flavour jet. $W$ jets with origin
other than what is discussed above fall into the 
category denoted by ``\ttbar, other''. This category includes
events in which at least one of the $W$ jets comes from a
hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton. 

%%% single top
In addition to \ttbar\ production, there are some minor backgrounds
that contribute to the final event sample that is used for the calibration.
These backgrounds consist mostly of single-top and diboson production, 
the production of \ttbar\ in association with a vector boson
and the production of a vector boson in association with jets.
The details
of the modeling of these samples are given in the following.

Single-top $s$-channel production is modelled using the \powhegbox~v2 %~\cite{Alioli:2009je,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
generator at NLO in QCD in the five-flavour scheme with the \nnpdfnlo~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF) set.
%The events are interfaced with \pythia.230 % ~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} 
%using the A14 tune % ~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}
%and the \nnpdftwo PDF set.
%
The associated production of top quarks with $W$ bosons ($tW$) is
modelled using the
\powhegbox~v2~\cite{Re:2010bp,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
generator at NLO in QCD using the five-flavour scheme and the
\nnpdfnlo set of PDFs~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}.
The diagram removal scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi} is used to
remove interference and overlap with \ttbar\ production. 
The events for both single-top $s$-channel and $tW$ production 
are interfaced to \pythia.230%~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} 
using the A14 tune%~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} 
and the \nnpdftwo set of PDFs. %~\cite{Ball:2012cx}.

The production of $Z+$jets and $W$+jets is simulated with the
\sherpa~v2.2.1~\cite{Bothmann:2019yzt}
generator using next-to-leading order (NLO) matrix elements (ME) for up to two partons, and leading order (LO) matrix elements
for up to four partons calculated with the Comix~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv}
and \openloops~\cite{Buccioni:2019sur,Cascioli:2011va,Denner:2016kdg} libraries. They
are matched with the \sherpa parton shower~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} using the MEPS@NLO
prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd,Hoeche:2012yf,Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj}
using the set of tuned parameters developed by the \sherpa authors.
The \nnpdfnnlo set of PDFs~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} is used and the samples
are normalised to a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
prediction~\cite{Anastasiou:2003ds}.

Samples of diboson final states ($VV$) are simulated with the
\sherpa~v2.2.1 or v2.2.2~\cite{Bothmann:2019yzt} generator depending on the process,
%~\footnote{This is an admixture of 2.2.1 and above versions, so the version should be kept generic to avoid confusions. As an alternative, the sentence can be modified indicating that samples are simulated with the \sherpa~v2.2.1 or v2.2.2 depending on the process.} 
including off-shell effects and Higgs-boson contributions, where appropriate.
Fully leptonic final states and semileptonic final states, where one boson
decays leptonically and the other hadronically, are generated using
matrix elements at NLO accuracy in QCD for up to one additional parton
and at LO accuracy for up to three additional parton
emissions. Samples for the loop-induced processes $gg \to VV$ are
generated using LO-accurate matrix elements for up to one
additional parton emission for both cases of fully leptonic and
semileptonic final states. The matrix element calculations are matched
and merged with the \sherpa parton shower based on Catani-Seymour
dipole factorisation~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv,Schumann:2007mg} using the MEPS@NLO
prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd,Hoeche:2012yf,Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj}.
The virtual QCD correction are provided by the
\openloops library~\cite{Buccioni:2019sur,Cascioli:2011va,Denner:2016kdg}. The
\nnpdfnnlo set of PDFs is used, %~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}, 
along with the dedicated set of tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the
\sherpa authors.

The production of \ttbar\ in assosiation with a vector boson 
is modelled using the
\mgamc~v2.3.3~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} generator at NLO with the
\nnpdfnlo~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF).
The events are interfaced to \pythia.210~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}~
using the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the
\nnpdftwo~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF set. The decays of bottom and charm
hadrons are simulated using the \evtgen\ v1.2.0 program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.



\section{Kinematic Likelihood Fitter}
\label{KLFitter}
% Top quarks decay to a $W$ boson and a bottom quark in nearly 100\% of all 
% cases. Consequently, the final state of a top-quark pair is characterised by 
% the decay products of the two $W$ bosons. 
% %If one of the $W$ bosons decays into a charged lepton and a neutrino while the other one decays into a pair of quarks, the decay mode is referred to as the single-lepton, or semi-leptonic decay mode. 
% The fraction of top-quark pairs decaying either in the 
% single-electron or single-muon decay mode 
% is about 30\%. The corresponding event signature is defined 
% by exactly one electron or muon, four jets out of which 
% two contain a $b$-hadron, and a large amount of missing transverse momentum 
% due to the un-detected neutrino. The Kinematic Likelihood Fitter\cite{ERDMANN201418}, 
% is a reconstruction technique developed to reconstruct $t\bar{t}$ decays, 
% which exploits the above decay topology of the top quark in the 
% semi-leptonic channel in order to properly associate jets to the 
% quarks in the final state of the decay process. In the semi-leptonic 
% decay of the $t\bar{t}$ system, the resulting tree level situation 
% contains two $b$ quarks from the top quark decays, and two light or 
% charm quarks from the $W$ boson decay (Figure~\ref{fig:feynman}). 
% A likelihood is used to properly assign these four jets to the true 
% decay quarks. The leading order scenario is assumed, giving rise to four jets 
% in the final $t\bar{t}$ decay topology, two of which are \bjets. Three 
% of the jets in the decay are associated to the hadronic top decay, 
% whereas a final fourth jet along with the charged lepton and 
% neutrino build the leptonic top\cite{cjet}.
The four-vectors of the four highest \pt\ jets, the lepton and the
event \MET\ are used as inputs to a likelihood-based \ttbar\ event
reconstruction algorithm, which is described in more detail in
Ref.~\cite{ERDMANN201418}. This algorithm uses a likelihood function
to assign the four jets to the \ttbar\ decay topology. In particular,
the algorithm assigns one jet to be the \bjet\ from the leptonically
decaying top quark ($t\to Wb \to \ell \nu b$), another to the \bjet\
from the hadronically decaying top quark ($t\to Wb \to qq^\prime b$,
where $qq^\prime$ are the quarks in which the $W$ boson decays) and
the remaining two jets to the jets that come from the hadronic $W$
boson decay. The jet assignment does not use any \btagging\ information
to avoid bias.



\section{Maximising likelihood}
\label{maximise likelihood}
Taking only four jets in the event limits the total number of possible 
jet orderings (permutations) in the event. In the semi-leptonic channel, 
four jets can be permuted a total number of times equal to 4! = 24. 
However, the two $W$ jets are kinematically indistinguishable. 
This reduces the possible number of permutations to 12. 
%Furthermore, no $b$-tagging information is used 
%in the kinematic likelihood to limit the possible number of permutations
%as this would bias the result.
For every combination of jet ordering, 
the likelihood is maximised over 
its free parameters, the energy of the four jets, the lepton energy and 
the three components of the momentum of the neutrino, and provides a 
value based on how closely the kinematic information from the reconstructed 
objects for a specific jet ordering resembles the expected kinematic behaviour 
of the decay of a Standard Model semi-leptonic $t\bar{t}$ event. The likelihood 
therefore distinguishes the possible permutations on an event-by-event basis. 
The best permutation, given by the largest log-likelihood value, is adopted 
as the jet ordering for the event. 
\begin{figure}[bth]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{FTAG_plots/pretagNoRwwithhighpTPFlowall/DataMC_h_LLR.png}
	\caption{Distribution of  the negative logarithm of the likelihood that
	is used to reconstruct the \ttbar\ decay.}
	\label{fig:llr}
\end{figure}
An additional requirement of log-likelihood > -48 is 
placed on the output of the likelihood value for the chosen event permutation. 
An example of the distribution of log-likelihood of the best permutations 
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:llr}. 
In this figure, the data events are compared against the simulation.
The majority of the events come from \ttbar\ production. There is only
a very small fraction of events, which is denoted as ``non \ttbar''
on the figure, that come from other processes like $W$ or $Z$ production
in association with jets or single-top production.


\section{Event selection}
\label{Event selection}
 % The analysis uses the full available integrated luminosity collected with the ATLAS detector from the all years. This corresponds to a collected luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. The event selection aims to select a sample enriched in $t\bar{t}$ events. The lowest un-prescaled single electron and single-muon triggers are used.
\subsection{Standard selection}
\label{standard selection}
Events are required to contain exactly one trigger-matched 
lepton with $p_{T} > 27$~GeV and exactly four jets with 
$p_{T} > 25$~GeV. Leptons are required to have $p_{T}$ 
above 27~GeV in order to avoid the turn-on curve for the 
single lepton triggers. Events which contain an additional 
lepton with $p_T > 27$~GeV are rejected. 
The events are also required to have $\MET > 20$~GeV, which is 
assumed to be the result of the neutrino from the leptonically 
decaying $W$ boson. The transverse
mass $m_T$ between the lepton and the \MET, is
constrained as follows:
\[ m_T = \sqrt{2 p_T^\ell \MET (1-\cos\Delta\phi)} > 40~\GeV,\]
where $\Delta\phi = \phi(\MET)-\phi(\ell)$ is the azimuthal difference between
the lepton and \MET.

% Due to the requirement on jet $p_T$ and binning strategy, the calibration 
% result can be applied to jets with $p_{T}$ between 25 to 200~GeV. 
The yields of the data and the MC are given in Table \ref{tab:yields_standard}.
An example of the \pt\ distributions
before any tagging or fitting and 
after the standard selection is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kinematic_distributions_standard}. 
More plots can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_standard_selection}.
The yellow band in the lower pad shows the overall systematic uncertainties, combining the 
experimental uncertainties and the \ttbar\ modelling uncertainties, as described in 
Section \ref{sec:FTAG_systematics}. The data/MC ratio shows good agreement 
within the systematic uncertainties. 

\subsection{Low-\pt\ selection}
\label{sec:lowpT_selection}
The author has developed an othorgonal selection to 
extend the calibration in the low-$p_{T}$ region so that the calibration 
can be applied to PFlow jets with $20< \pt\ < 25$~GeV.
The \pt\ threshold of the VR-Track jets is $10$~GeV 
therefore the low-\pt\ selection is not needed. 
Instead of requiring events to 
have exactly 4 jets $\pt\ > 25$~GeV, events are required to have exactly 3 jets with $p_{T} > 25$~GeV 
and exactly 1 jet with $25$~GeV $> p_{T} > 20$~GeV. Other than that, 
all requirements for the selection are the same. 
This additional cut provides candidates for the PFlow $W$ jet that is used 
for calibration in the $20-25$~GeV region. 
The inclusive yields of the low-\pt\ selection 
of the data and the MC are given in Table \ref{tab:yields_lowpT}, and
the \pt\ distributions of the $W$ jets are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kinematic_distributions_lowpT}.
More plots of the kinematic distributions
are shown in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_lowpT_selection}. 
Good agreement between MC and data 
is shown in these distributions, and the $p_{T}$ range of the sub-leading has gone down to 20~GeV.

\subsection{High-$p_T$ selection}
\label{high_pt_selection}
It has been observed that in the previous calibrations that the statistics 
are relatively low for the high-\pt\ region (e.g.\ jet $\pt\ > 100$~GeV). 
Therefore, the author has worked on an othorgonal selection to improve this situation.
Instead of requiring events to have exactly 4 jets, events are required to 
have at least 5 jets with $p_{T} > 25$~GeV, in which at least 
1 jet with $\pt\ > 70$~GeV. Other than that, all 
requirements for the selection remain the same. 


The choice of cut value at $70$~GeV is based on the
study shown in the following. 
The effect on the \cjet\ purity and the potential statistical gain is investigated, 
where the \cjet\ purity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\cjetineq\ \rm{purity} = \frac{N_{\rm{true}\ \cjetunder}}{N_{\rm{all}}},
\end{equation}
where $N_{\rm{true}\ \cjetunder}$ stands for the number of events with a 
true \cjet\ from the $W$ decay, and $N_{\rm{all}}$ stands for the number of all events. 
The ideal situation is the high-\pt\ selection will maximally increase the 
statistics while mininally decreasing the \cjet\ purity, therefore a figure of merit $P^{\rm{Cut}}$
is defined as:
\[P^{\rm{Cut}} = \frac{\sum_i{\rm{Gain\ in\ stats}^2_i}}{\sum_i{\cjetineq \rm{purity}^2_i }}, \]
where i stands for the number of bins. The ``Gain in stats'' stands for increase in 
statistics and it's summed over all bins in Figure~\ref{fig:cutvalue}.
The \cjet\ purity and the statistical gain are calculated for 4 different cut 
values as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cutvalue}, comparing with the cut value of 0. 
The value of $70$~GeV is chosen as it gives the highest value of $P^{\rm{Cut}}$.

\subsection{Combined selection}
\label{combined_selection}
As the standard selections, low-\pt\ selection and high-\pt\ selection are othorgonal 
to each other, all the selections are combined to provide the maximum range 
and statistics for the calibration. 
The yields of the data and the MC are given in Table \ref{tab:yields_combined},

after the combined selection is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kinematic_distributions_combined}. More plots

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:FTAG_systematics}
The systematic uncertainties considered and propagated in this calibration 
can be broadly categorised into experimental and modelling systematic uncertainties. 
\subsection{Experimental uncertainties}
TODO: refer to the analysis Part
Experimental uncertainties are related to the detector and estimated using 
data-driven methods or MC simulations. 
The lepton energy scale and resolution are corrected to 
provide better agreement between MC predictions and data, uncertainties 
due the corrections are considered. Uncertainties are taken into account on the 
electron and muon trigger, identification and reconstruction efficiencies, and for 
uncertainties associated with the isolation requirements. 

The jet energy scale (JES) uncertainty depends on $p_T$ and $\eta$ and 
takes into account uncertainties due to pile-up effects. Uncertainties on the jet energy resolution (JER) 
are taken into account. Uncertainties on the energy scale and resolution of 
the electrons, muons, jets and taus are propagated to the calculation of the \MET, 
which also has additional dedicated uncertainties on the scale, resolution, and 
reconstruction efficiency of tracks not associated to any of the reconstructed objects,
 along with the modelling of the underlying event. Uncertainties on the $b$-tagging (mis-tagging) 
 probabilities for $b$ (light) jets are considered both for the tagging jets assigned to the $b$ quark 
 from the top decay and for the jets associated to the hadronically decaying $W$ boson.
Supporting material for this section can be found in the appendix, Tab.\ref{tab:systematics}.
%The uncertainty on these corrections is taken into account as a shape-dependent systematic uncertainty in the final fit of the backgrounds and signal models.

\subsection{Modelling uncertainties} 
The uncertaity due to different choices of the parton shower models is estimated by comparing
the MC samples generated with nominal parton shower model and with the 
alternative parton shower model.
More specifically, it is derived 
by comparing the prediction from \powheg interfaced either to \pythia or \Herwigpp. 
The uncertainty due to additional radiation in 
the initial state and the final state is estimated by comparing the nominal MC samples with the MC samples 
with alternative scale of renormalisation and factorisation.
The uncertainty on modelling of initial state radiation (ISR) is assessed with two alternative \powhegpythia 
samples. The samples include one with an increase in radiation which has the renormalisation and 
factorisation scales decreased by a factor of two and the \textit{hdamp} parameter doubled 
(which controls the \pt\ of the first additional emission), while 
the sample with a decrease in radiation has the scales increased by a factor of two. 
In all cases, MC-to-MC SFs are taken into account.
In addition, the uncertainty due to the
variations samples being produced by fast simulation while the nominal samples being 
produced full simulation is also considered.
The comparisons of 
the nominal \ttbar\ sample and the samples with each systematic uncertainty 
are shown in Table \ref{tab:modelling_syst}.

\section{Under-estimation of $t\bar{t}$ + Heavy flavour background }
Depsite the fact that the true nature of most of the reconstructed $W$ jets are either 
\cjets\ or light jets, there is still a very small amount of them are true \bjets. 

There are two main sources of these true \bjets. The first is a $W$ boson 
decays to a $b$ and a $c$ quark. The second is 
when the $t\bar{t}$ plus a gluon process (referred to as \ttbar\ + heavy flavour process)
is selected, and the gluon splits
into a pair a $b$ quarks and one of them is assigned as a $W$ jet. 
The first source can be excluded by requiring no \cjets in the $W$ jets,
meaning the true \bjet\ in the $W$ jets 
can only come from the $t\bar{t}$ + heavy flavour 
process. This process is underestimated by the MC by about 30\% 
for both the PFlow and VR-Track jets collections, as shown in Table \ref{tab:3byields1} 
and Figure~\ref{fig:3bplots}, where an extra cut requiring at least one $W$ jet with DL1r $> 8$ 
is added to the combined selection to reject most of the true \cjets and true light jet. 
A more thorough study is done in Ref.~\cite{TOPQ-2017-12}, where the mis-modelling 
factor is measured to be $1.25 \pm 0.25$, which is also consistent with the $30\%$ 
mismodelling observed in the previous study. 
Therefore, events in the simulation
in which the top jets and at least one of the $W$ jets are \bjets (referred to as 3 true \bjets\ events), 
are scaled by $1.25 \pm 0.25$.
All results shown in this chapter have this scale factor implemented, 
and the full difference between the simulation before applying this scale factor and 
after is taken as a systematic uncertainty. This uncertainty has been added in quadrature 
to the systematic uncertainties described in Section \ref{sec:FTAG_systematics} 
in all the plots in this chapter.

\section{Results}
\label{result}


\subsection{Overview}
Four rounds of calibrations have been carried out, containing different 
jet collections, Monte Carlo samples, analysis framework 
and \bjet\ identification algorithm. 
In the latest round, 
the calibration includes the PFlow jet and the VR-Track jet collection, 
and MV2c10, DL1 and DL1r taggers. The low-$p_T$ 
selection and the standard selection are carried out for all four 
calibrations, while the high-$p_T$ selection is only implemented 
in the latest calibration. 

\subsection{\btagging\ algorithms output distribution}
The distributions of the \btagging\ algorithm' output of 
the MC and the data of the latest calibration 
(December 2020) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:taggers_PFlow} for the PFlow jets and 
Figure~\ref{fig:taggers_VRJets} for the VR-Track jets, 
combining the standard selection, low \pt\ and the high-$p_T$ selection. 
In these figure, the data events are compared against the simulation.
The majority of the events come from \ttbar\ production. There is only
a very small fraction of non \ttbar\ events. The $W$ jets pairs are mostly light jets 
pairs and \cjet\ light jet pairs, and a very small fraction of the pairs are 
\bjet\ light jet pairs or pairs containing one or more $\tau$ hadron(s). 
The yellow band in the lower pad indicates the overall systematic uncertainties
and the black band represents the \ttbar\ modelling systematic uncertainty, 
which dominates at low \btagging\ discriminant (DL1 or DL1r < 4). 
The experimental systematic uncertainty is in general very small. 
At high \btagging\ discriminant (DL1 or DL1r > 4), the
uncertainty due to the $1.25 \pm 0.25$ scale factor 
becomes more important.

\subsection{Efficiencies and Scale Factors}
%The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates good agreement in different kinematic variables with data. 
The Dl1 and DL1r \cjet efficiencies and scale factors with systematics 
uncertainties are calculated with four fixed cut working points 
for the PFlow and VR VR-Track jets collection in the latest derivation 
in December 2020.

The \cjet\ mis-tagging efficiencies are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Dec_eff_PFlow_DL1}-\ref{fig:Dec_eff_VRJets_DL1r} 
for the PFlow jet collections and the VR-Track jets with the DL1 and the DL1r tagger. 
For PFlow jets, these results combine the standard selection, low\pt\ selection and the high-$p_T$ selection 
and for the VR-Track jets they combine the standard selection and the high-$p_T$ selection. 

The $1.25 \pm 0.25$ scale factor is applied on events with 3 true \bjets. 
The overall uncertainties are shown 
in the red band. 
The scale factors are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Dec_SF_PFlow_DL1}-\ref{fig:Dec_SF_VRJets_DL1r} for the PFlow jets
and the VR-Track jets with the DL1 and DL1r tagger. 
The tighter working points (60\%, 70\%) show larger uncertainties and bigger deviation from 1, while
the looser working points (77\%, 85\%) have much smaller uncertainty and the simulation is able to 
recover the data well due to more abundant events statistics.
For the PFlow jets, in most of the working points the systematic uncertainties dominate 
in the low-\pt\ bins (\pt\ < 150) and the statistical error, represented by the error bars on the 
markers, become more important in the last bin. 
For the VR-Track jets the statistical uncertainty is relatively constant for all bins while the 
systematic uncertainty increases as the \pt\ increases. 
To demonstrate the effect on statistics with the high-\pt\ selection, 
the fractional statistical uncertainties of 60\% working point scale factor
are shown in Table \ref{tab:stats_gain} for the standard and the combined selection.
In some bins the statistical uncertainty can decrease up to 30\%, suggesting that the
high-\pt\ selection is successful at increasing events statistics.

In terms of statistical gain, taking the 60\% working point scale factor with 2018 data as an example, the error is reduced as expected. In the last bin of the $p_{T}$ distribution of scale factors, the error is reduced by 55\%, which suggests the success of high-$p_{T}$ selection method. The percentage reduction of error of each bin is given in Tab.\ref{tab:limit}:
