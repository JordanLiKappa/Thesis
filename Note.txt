Things to be included:
FTAG chpater:
0. clarify fixed cut
0. Scale factos are repeated in the calibration method and result section. Remove the repeated part
1.IP2D/3D definition in object reco definition
2.remove the overlapping samples with the Data/MC section and add extra samples. 
check if modulo ttV is an extra sample specific to the calibration
3. PFlow and VR track jet definition in object reco definition
4. refer to the experimental uncertaity in analysis 

Detector chapeter:
1. add reference to "more details in the parton model section"
2. check definition of pileup

Reconstruction chapter:
1. remove truth information if mention earlier
Kalman filter:
in its linear form the Kalman filter is the optimal recursive estimator of the state vector of a (discrete) linear dynamic system.
In such a system the evolution of the state vector is described by a linear transformation plus a random disturbance w, 
which is the process noise:
x_k = F_(k-1)x_(k-1) + w_(k-1),
where F is the propagator from detector k-1 to k
