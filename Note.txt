Things to be included:
FTAG chpater:
0. clarify fixed cut
0. Scale factos are repeated in the calibration method and result section. Remove the repeated part
1.IP2D/3D definition in object reco definition
2.remove the overlapping samples with the Data/MC section and add extra samples. 
check if modulo ttV is an extra sample specific to the calibration
3. PFlow and VR track jet definition in object reco definition
4. refer to the experimental uncertaity in analysis 

Detector chapeter:
1. add reference to "more details in the parton model section"
2. check definition of pileup

Reconstruction chapter:
1. remove truth information if mention earlier
Kalman filter:
in its linear form the Kalman filter is the optimal recursive estimator of the state vector of a (discrete) linear dynamic system.
In such a system the evolution of the state vector is described by a linear transformation plus a random disturbance w, 
which is the process noise:
x_k = F_(k-1)x_(k-1) + w_(k-1),
Gaussian-sum flter GSF: 
The GSF method [32] is based on a generalisation of
the Kalman filter [33] and takes into account the non-linear
effects related to bremsstrahlung. Within the GSF, experi-
mental noise is modelled by a sum of Gaussian functions.
The GSF therefore consists of a number of Kalman filters
running in parallel, the result of which is that each track
parameter is approximated by a weighted sum of Gaussian
functions.where F is the propagator from detector k-1 to k

2. muon is minimaly ionising. For particles with mass much bigger than electron, 
the energy is lost mostly by ionisation. The rate of lost is a function of beta*gamma. 
Beyond the maximum, stopping power decreases approximately like 1/v2 with increasing particle velocity v, 
but after a minimum, it increases again (bremsstrahlung starting to become important).
The minimum for mu interaction with cupper is around 5 GeV, and after 1 TeV the bremsstrahlung starts to
take off. 
  


2. TODO: Find electron identification and isolation working points for bbtautau and Ftag
3. TODO: add reference of validation of swithcing from EMTOPO to PFLow after selection is defined
4.  TODO: link the RNN 0.01 to the fake factor section
5. think about why random tau selection is needed
6. check the rejection rate of the BDT for reject electron faking tau
Important points (from Nikos):  
5. check what muon is used for bbtautau
1. calibration for electron and muons?
8. why RNN tau is better than bdt? 
9. does anti-tau fit in the object reconstruction? 

DiHiggs:
1. how to explain non res signal is normalised to the SM cross section while the resonant cross section is arbitrary?

DiHiggs note:
1. Fastsim: 
Almost 80% of the full simulation time is spent simu-
lating particles traversing the calorimetry, and about 75%
of the full simulation time is spent simulating electromag-
netic particles. Fast sim is to remove low energy electro magnetic 
particles from the calorimeter and replace them
with pre-simulated showers stored in memory

Reconstruction: 
    one week (due 20/10)
    correction: half a week 

analysis: 
    5 weeks  (due 15/12)
    correction: one week


Theory and motivation:
    4 weeks (due 7/2, including vacations)
    correction: one week





Hi Nikos, I have another question on a comment:
1. what do you mean by "normal jet reconstruction"?
2. so the instrinsic difference between emtopo and pflow jet is that, the emtopo is based on clusters of EM calorimeter cells, while the pflow is based on clusters of energy-subtracted cells?
