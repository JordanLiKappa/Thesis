\section{The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider}
\subsection{The Large Hadron Collider}

The Large Hadron Collider~\cite{Evans:2008zzb} is the world's 
largest and most powerful particle accelerator. 
It started in 2008 and remains its crucial role in the many 
accelerators at CERN and in the world.
The main body of the collider consists of a ring tunnel of 
perimeter of 26.7 km, lies beneath the France-Switzerland near
Geneva,with superconducting magnets along the tunnel to keep the 
particle beam in direction
 and a large number of accelerating structures to boost the 
 beam to the desired energy.

Inside the tunnel, two beams of particles travelling at close 
to the speed of light 
in opposite direction are made to collide. 
These two beams are kept in separate beam pipes,
cooled to $-271.3^\circ C$ ($1.9\ K$) with liquid 
helium distributed by dedicated system, 
 and ultra-high vacuum, a vacuum thinner than 
interstellar void, matianed for 48 km of low-temperature 
section and 6 km of room-temperature 
section. 

Thousands of magnets are used to direct the beams 
along the beam pipe, either to bend the beams or
to focus. The particles are so small that making them collide is akin to 
firing two needles 10 kilometers away and meet halfway. 

All the controls for the accelerator, its services and technical infrastructure 
are located at the CERN Control Centre. 
From here, the beams inside the LHC are made to collide 
at four locations around the accelerator ring, 
corresponding to the positions of four particle 
detectors – ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)~\cite{PERF-2007-01}, 
CMS~\cite{CMS-2008xjf} (Compact Muon Solenoid), ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) 
\cite{ALICE-2008ngc} and LHCb (b stands for beauty)~\cite{LHCb-2008vvz}.


	\subsubsection{Design and performance}

	The LHC is a two-ring-superconducting-hadron accelerator and collider
	installed in the existing tunnel that was 
	constructed between 1984 and 1989 
	for the CERN LEP machine. The LEP tunnel has 
	eight straight sections and eight arcs 
	and lies between 45 m and 170 m below the 
	surface on a plane inclined at 1.4\% sloping towards the Léman lake.
	Approximately 90\% of its length is in molasse rock, 
	which has excellent characteristics for this application,
	and 10\% is in limestone under the Jura mountain. 
	There are two transfer tunnels, 
	each approxi-mately 2.5 km in length, linking the 
	LHC to the CERN accelerator complex that acts as injector.
	As mentioned before, the beam piples are maintained in 
	vacuum for low and high temperature section.
	For the low temperature section, the vacuum is achieved 
	by pumping in 9000 $m^3$ of cryogenic
	gas, which later will be condensed and adhered to the 
	surface of the beampipe. For the room temperature
	section, the vacuum is achieved by use of 
	non-evaporable getter (NEG) that absorbs residue gas particles 
	when heated. More residue is absorbed by ion pumper. 
	
	The proton-proton collider has advantages 
	and disadvantages compared to a
	proton-anti-proton collider or an electron-positron collider. 
	Two rings are needed to accommodate the two 
	counter-rotation beams, unlike particle-antiparticle 
	colliders that can have both beams sharing the same 
	phase space in a single ring.
	However it would not be possible to to 
	achieve such high luminosity using
	anti-proton beams. 
	
	In principle, the mass of the proton is much larger than 
	the mass of the electron, the
	synchrotron radiation losses will be much smaller, and 
	the long straight sections designed for
	compensate the losses (as designed in the LEP) can be reduced. 
	However these sections are kept 
	as the LEP has as a cost-effective solution. 
	The tunnel in the arcs has a finished internal diameter of 3.7~m. 
		
	\begin{figure}[bht]
		\begin{centering}	
		\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Detector_plots/LHC-double-bore-magnet.jpg}
		\caption{ Double-bore magnet configuration of the LHC 
		superconducting magnets~\cite{rossi2003lhc}.}
		\label{fig:double-bore-magnet}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}

	Due to the technical difficulties to install 
	two separate rings in such small space,
	LHC adopted the twin-bore magnet design~\cite{rossi2003lhc}, 
	as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:double-bore-magnet}.
	It was proposed by John Blewett at the Brookhaven 
	laboratory in 1971 first for
	cost consideration~\cite{Blewett:1971zzb},
	but in the case of the LHC the overriding reason for adopting this solution
	is the lack of space in the tunnel. 

	The aim of the LHC is to reveal the physics beyond
	the Standard Model with centre of mass 
	collision energies of up to 14 TeV.
	The number of events per second generated in the LHC collisionsis given by:
	\[
		N_{event} = L\sigma_{event},\]
	where $\sigma_event$ is the cross section 
	for the event under study and $L$ the machine luminosity. 
	The machine luminosity depends on the beam parameters 
	and can be written for a Gaussian beam distribution as:
	\[
	L = \frac{N_b^2 n_b f_{rev} \gamma_r}{4\pi \epsilon_n \beta*} F,
	\]

	where $N_b$ refers to the number of particles per bunch,
	$n_b$ number of bunches per beam,
	$f_{rev}$ revolution frequency, 
	$\gamma_r$ relativistic gamma factor, 
	$\epsilon_r$ normalized transverse beam emittance, 
	$\beta*$~beta function at the collision point which
	describes the size of the beam, 
	and	$F$ refers to the geometric luminosity reduction factor due to the 
	crossing angle at the interaction point~(IP).

	The two high luminosity experiments, ATLAS and CMS are
	both aiming at a peak luminosity of $L$ = $10^{34}cm^2s^1$ for proton operation.
	The two low luminosity experiments: LHCB for 
	B-physics, is aiming at a peak luminosity of $L$ = $10^{32}cm^2s^1$, 
	and the dedicated ion experiment, ALICE, is aiming at apeak luminosity of
	$L$ = $10^{27}cm^2s^1$ for nominal lead-lead ion operation.


	\begin{figure}[bht]

		\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{Detector_plots/accelerator_complex_smaller.png}
		\caption{The LHC is the last ring (dark blue line) in a complex chain of 
		particle accelerators. The smaller machines are used in a chain to help boost 
		the particles to their final energies and provide beams to a whole set of smaller experiments.
			}
		\label{fig:accelerator_complex}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	The proton beams are designed to carry energy of the order of a few TeV.
	To reach such high energy, a series of acceleration is required for the beams before
	entering the LHC ring. The protons are supplied by the injector chain 
	Linac2 — Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) — Proton Synchrotron (PS) — Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), 
	as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:accelerator_complex}, 
	reaching an energy of 450 GeV when leaving the SPS. 
	Each proton beam contains 2808 ``bunches'' of approximately 
	$1.15 \times 10^{11}$ protons, arranged in 
	``trains'' of bunches with 72 bunches each ``carriage''. 
	Inside the ``carriage'', each beam has a spacing of 24.95 ns and between each 
	``carriage'' there is a gap of \~ 320 ns. 
	The beams are required to have well defined transverse and longitudinal emittance. 


	\subsubsection{Runs and results}
	\label{sec:runs and results}
	Following the downtime after an incident in one of the main dipole circuits 
	during the first commissioning in 2008~\cite{lebrun2009report},
	the operation restarted at lower beam energy to minimize the risk. 
	Therefore, the first proton run (2010-2013)~\cite{alemany2013operation} was
	carried out at 3.5–4 TeV (centre of mass energy 7-8 TeV). Furthermore, a bunch spacing
	of 50 ns was used instead of the nominal 25 ns. 
	This implied fewer bunches with larger intensity and hence a 
	high peak luminosity (0.8 $\times$ 10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ still smaller than
	the nominal 10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ luminosity) but larger than nominal pileup. 
	Run 1 resulted in about 30~\fb of proton data and important physics results,
	most notably the discovery of the Higgs boson~\cite{HIGG-2012-27},~\cite{HIGG-2012-28}.
	Run 1 was followed by a long shutdown (LS1, 2013–2014)
	with a large number of consolidation and upgrade activities~\cite{bordry2013first}. 	
	The bus-bar splices between the superconducting magnets were improved, 
	in order to make sure that the LHC could operate at higher energy 
	without risk of repeating the 2008 incident. 

	\begin{figure}[bht]
		\begin{centering}	
		\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{Detector_plots/Run2_lumi.png}
		\caption{Cumulative luminosity versus time delivered to 
		ATLAS (green), recorded by ATLAS (yellow), and certified to be 
		good quality data (blue) during stable beams for pp collisions 
		at 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy in Run 2. 
			}
		\label{fig:Run2_lumi}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	
	Run 2 (2016-2018) was carried out
	at 6.5 TeV (center of mass energy 13 TeV)~\cite{LHC-Run2-Operation}. 
	As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Run2_lumi}, out of the 156~\fb 
	of data LHC has delivered, the ATLAS detector has recorded 
	147~\fb and \lumi of data is certified to be good quality data.
	The delivered luminosity accounts for the luminosity delivered from the start of 
	stable beams until the LHC requests ATLAS to put the detector in a 
	safe standby mode to allow a beam dump or beam studies. 
	The recorded luminosity is slightly smaller than the delivered luminosity, due 
	to the inefficiency of the Data Acquisition (DAQ) and the so called ``warm start'': 
	when the stable beam flag is raised, 
	the tracking detectors undergo a ramp of the high-voltage and, 
	for the pixel system, turning on the pre-amplifiers. 
	More details of the ATLAS detector can be found in the following sections. 
	The recorded data is checked carefully to exclude possible hardware or software  issues. 
	This is achieved by monitoring detector-level quantities 
	and reconstructed collision event characteristics at key stages of the data processing chain.
	This procedure led to high efficiency of good quality data: 95.6\%~\cite{aad2020atlas}.	

	\begin{figure}[bht]
		\begin{centering}	
		\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{Detector_plots/Run2_pileup.png}
		\caption{ Shown is the luminosity-weighted distribution of the mean number of 
		interactions per crossing for the Run 2 data. All data recorded by ATLAS during 
		stable beams is shown, and the integrated luminosity and 
		the mean mu value are given in the figure. 
			}
		\label{fig:Run2_pileup}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}

	In this thesis the \lumi data recorded by the ATLAS detector of Run 2 is used.
	The nominal bunch spacing of 25 ns was used, with slightly less bunches (2500) each beam.
	The LHC experts have continually improved the running scenario to increase the luminosity,
	and during Run 2 the luminosity surpassed the designed luminosity by a factor of 2. 
	As well as improving the instantaneous luminosity, the availability of the machine
	was dramatically improved during Run 2 which is an important factor enabling the high efficiency 
	of good quality data as mentioned above.
	During Run 2, the machine was providing physics collisions during 50\% of 
	the allocated physics time, which is very impressive for a super conducting collider. 
	An important parameter for the LHC experiments is the pileup, 
	which is determined by the luminosity per bunch, and is a measure of 
	the number of inelastic pp interactions that occur per bunch crossing. 

	Higher pileup gives more luminosity (for a fixed number of bunches) 
	but makes physics analysis more difficult due to the signals in the detector 
	from the additional interactions. The distribution of the recorded luminosity over
	the pileup is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Run2_pileup}. It's a challenging task for the 
	trigger and reconstruction algorithms to achieve robustness under such high pileup 
	condition.

	The LHC operation and shutdown schedule is shown 
	in Figure~\ref{fig:LHC-longterm-schedule}
	and Figure~\ref{fig:LHC-schedule-lumi}.
	The operation of CERN’s accelerators is subject to scheduled shutdowns 
	to allow important repair and upgrade work to take place. 
	The present shutdown, LS2, is devoted to preparations for Run 3 of the LHC, 
	which will have an integrated luminosity equal to the two previous runs combined, 
	and for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), 
	the successor to the LHC, which will begin operation at the end of 2027,
	and eventually generate 10 times the integrated luminosity to
	all Run 1, 2, 3 combined!
	
	The LS2 schedule has had to be modified due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
	which the new schedule anticipates that the first test beams will 
	circulate in the LHC 
	at the end of September 2021, four months later than the date 
	planned before the COVID-19 crisis, 
	to give the LHC’s main experiments – ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb – 
	time to prepare their own upgrade. 
	Run 3 of the LHC will begin at the start of March 2022.
	% No changes have been made to the schedule beyond 2022.
	The third long shutdown (LS3) will begin at the 
	start of 2025 and end in mid-2027. 
	This is when the equipment for the HL-LHC and 
	its experiments will be installed. 
	





\subsection{The ATLAS Detector}

	\caption{Cut-away view of the ATLAS detector.

	\end{centering}
\end{figure}

ATLAS is one of the 
two general purpose detectors built for probing proton-proton 
collision. This detector represents the work of a large collaboration 
of several thousand physicists, engineers, technicians,
and students over a period of fifteen years of dedicated 
design, development, fabrication, and installation.
A overall layout of the detector is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS_cut_away}.

The high interaction rates, radiation doses, particle 
multiplicities and energies, as well as the
requirements for precision measurements have set strigent
standards on the design of the ATLAS detector. 
Therefore the ATLAS detector is designed to fufiled the following 
requirements:

	\label{tab:ATLAS_performance}
\end{table}




\begin{itemize}
\item
The detector requires fast, radiation-resistant  
electronics and sensor elements and high detector granularity
to meet the requirements due to the high frequency of collision,
high particle fluxes and high radiation environment of the
detector.


\item
Due to the geometry of the detector, to collect most of the 
collision data, large acceptance in pseudorapidity (which will be defined
in the next subsection: \ref{sec:detector coordinate}) 
with almost full azimuthal angle coverage is required.


\item
Good energy and momentum resolution are required to 
enable accurate physical objects reconstruction. 
The high resolution of energy can be obtained 
with very good electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry for 
electron and photon identification and measurements,
complemented by full-coverage hadronic calorimetry 
for accurate jet and missingtransverse energy measurements.


\item
For offline tagging of $\tau$-leptons and b-jets, vertex 
detectors close to the interaction region are 
required to observe secondary vertices.


\item
Good muon identification and momentum resolution 
over a wide range of momenta and the ability 
to determine unambiguously the charge of high 
\pt\ muons are fundamental requirements.


\item

Triggering with high efficiency on \pt\  
objects with sufficient background rejection is a 
prerequisite to achieve an acceptable trigger rate 
for most physics processes of interest.
\end{itemize}


The main performance goals of the detector are 
listed in Table \ref{tab:ATLAS_performance}. 


\subsubsection{Coordinate system}
	\label{sec:detector coordinate}



	The ATLAS coordinate system is a right-handed Cartesian system
	with the nominal interaction point 
	defined as the origin of the coordinate system,  
	while the beam direction defines the z-axis and 
	the x-y plane is transverse to the beam direction.  
	The positive x-axis is defined as pointing from 
	the interaction point to the centre of the
	LHC ring and the positive y-axis is defined as 
	pointing upwards, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS_coordinate_system}. 

	\begin{figure}[bht]
		\begin{centering}	
		\includegraphics[width=.55\textwidth]{Detector_plots/ATLAS coordinate system.png}
		\caption{Illustration of the coordinate systems 
		used at the ATLAS experiment in the geographical context of the LHC.
			}
		\label{fig:ATLAS_coordinate_system}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}

	The azimuthal angle $\phi$ 
	is measured as usual around the beam axis, and 
	the polar angle $\theta$ is the angle from the beam axis.  
	In high energy physics, it's more common to use the 
	pseudorapidity instead of the
	polar angle $\theta$, defined as:

	\[ \eta = -ln\ tan(\theta/2). \]

	In the case of highly relativistic particles
	(which is the comman case in high energy physics), 
	the pseudorapidity approaches the rapidity, 

	\[ y=1/2ln[(E+p_z)/(E-p_z)], \]

	with E the energy of the particle, m its mass 
	and $p_z$ the momentum along the z axis.

	There are two main reasons for using pseudorapidity.
	The first reason is that the rapidity is invariant
	under Lorentz transformation, while capturing 
	the characteristic of the particle direction of travel:
	$y \rightarrow \pm \infty $ when the particle is  
	travelling close to the beam pipe (positive for along the
	beam pipe, negative for the opposite direction) and
	$y \rightarrow 0$ when $p_z$ is small.
	While the second reason is that due to the limited
	angle coverage of the detector, it's usually hard
	to determine the total energy and the momentum 
	along the z axis, especially when the direction of 
	the particles are close to the beam pipe. 
	While the pseudorapidity is determined only by
	the polar angle, which is much easier and faster 
	to compute. 

	The transverse momentum \pt, the transverse energy
	$E_T$, and the missing transverse energy $E_{miss}^T$ (MET) 
	are defined in the x-y plane unless stated otherwise.  
	The distance $\Delta R$ in the pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle 
	space is defined as:

	\[\Delta R = \sqrt{\Delta \eta^2+\Delta\phi^2}.\]

\subsubsection{Magnets}


	ATLAS has a unique hybrid system of four large superconducting 
	magnets~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-06}. This magnetic system is 22 m in diameter and 26 m in length, 
	with a stored energy of 1.6 GJ.
	Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS_cut_away} shows the general layout, 
	the four main layers of detetors and the four superconducting 
	magnets which provide the magnetic
	field over a volume of approximately 12000 $m^3$.
	
	\begin{figure}[bht]
		\begin{centering}	
		\includegraphics[width=.36\textwidth]{Detector_plots/ATLAS magnets.png}
		\caption{Geometry of magnet windings and
		tile calorimeter steel.	}
		\label{fig:ATLAS_magnets}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}

	The spatial arrangement of the coil windings is shown in 
	Figure~\ref{fig:ATLAS_magnets}. 
	The ATLAS magnet system consists of two parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a solenoid, which is aligned on the beam axis and 
		provides a 2 T axial magnetic field in the z-direction. 
		For the inner detector, while minimising 
		the radiative thickness in front of the	barrel 
		electromagnetic calorimeter;
		\item  a barrel toroid and two end-cap toroids, 
		which produce a	toroidal magnetic field of approximately 
		0.5 T and 1 T for the muon detectors in the central 
		and end-cap regions, respectively. 
		The barrel toroid generates the magnetic field in the central zone 
		of the muon spectrometer, along the tangential direction of 
		the circumferences centered on the z-axis ($\phi$ direction). 
		The end-cap toroids are two smaller toroids designed to 
		provide the magnetic field in the forward areas of 
		the muon spectrometer. 
		
		
	\end{itemize}		
	Therefore in the ATLAS magnetic system, tracks in the inner detector
	is bended in the $\phi$ direction, while in the muon spectrometer 
	in the $\theta$ direction.


\subsubsection{Inner detector}	
	The innder detector~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-04} consists of three parts: the pixel detector~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-11}
	and	the insertable B-Layer (IBL)~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-19} (as one part),
	the silicon micro strip tracker (SCT)~\cite{}{ATLAS-TDR-04}, the transition radiation
	tracker (TRT)~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-04}. 
	Figure~\ref{fig:inner_detector} shows a 
	charge track traverses the sensors and structural
	elements. 
	\begin{figure}[bht]
		\begin{centering}	
		\includegraphics[width=.55\textwidth]{Detector_plots/Inner detector.png}
		\caption{Cut-away view of the inner detector.}
		\label{fig:inner_detector}
	\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	The track traverses successively the beryllium
	beam-pipe, the four cylindrical silicon-pixel layers 
	with individual 
	sensor elements of 50$\times$400 $\mu m^2$, the four cylindrical double 
	layers of barrel SCT of pitch 80 $\mu m$, 
	and approximately 36 axial straws of 4 $mm$ diameter 
	contained in the barrel TRT
	modules within their support structure.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Pixel detector and IBL}\\
	The silicon pixel detector is the closest ATLAS 
	component to the collision. It is composed of layers of
	silicon pixels and designed to have a very 
	high granularity for reconstructing primary 
	and secondary interaction vertices. 
	The detector layers are formed of silicon sensor modules and 
	in total there are approximately 92 million pixels 
	(consequently, 92 million readout channels) in the system.
	It consists of three cylindrical layers in the 
	barrel region, positioned at the radial distances of 
	50.5, 88.5 and 122.5 mm 
	and on disks perpendicular to the beams in the end-caps at the
	longitudinal distances of 49.5, 58.0 and 65.0 mm. 
	% The B-layer, placed at a distance of 50.5mm, plays 
	% an important role in detecting secondary vertices 
	% for the identification of jets coming from 
	% b-quark hadronisation (\bjets). 
	In 2014, during the first LHC long shutdown, a fourth pixel 
	layer was installed inside the existing detector, 
	the insertable B-Layer (IBL) at a radius of 33 mm 
	from the beam axis.
	The new pixel layer provides an 
	additional space point very close to the interaction point, 
	which significantly improves the identification of jets coming from 
	b-quark hadronisation (\bjets). 
	\item \textbf{SCT} \\
	The next constituent of the inner detector is the SCT, 
	which consists of four layers of strips located axially on the 
	beam direction in the barrel region and placed along the 
	\mbox{R-direction} in the end-cap region. 
	Each layer of strip is glued back to back with an angle of
	40 mrad. The spatial resolution of the sensor is 
	$\sigma_\phi = 17\ \mu m$ in the bending direction ($R-\phi$)
	and $\sigma_\phi = 580\ \mu m$ in the z (barrel) and R (end-cap) direction. 
	\item \textbf{TRT} \\
	The most external part of the inner detector is the TRT. 
	It is a straw drift tube tracker, with additional electron identification
	capabilities from transition radiation. It consists of
	modules of 4 mm diameter straws, filled with a mixture of gas of
	70\% Xe, 27\% CO2 and 3\% O2 immersed in a polypropylene radiator.
	Up to 73 straw layers of straws are interleaved with fibres in the barrel
	and 160 starw planes are interleaved with foils in the end-cap. 
	All charged tracks with \pt\ $> 0.5$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.0$ will traverse 
	at least 36 straws, except in the
	barrel-end-cap transition region ($0.8 < |\eta|< 1.0$), 
	where this number decreases to a minimum of 22 crossed straw.
	The TRT measures the track position only in the bending direction
	($R-\phi$), with a spatial resolution of $\sigma_\phi = 130\ \mu m$.
	The TRT contributes significantly to the pattern recognition and 
	momentum reconstruction, depsite the low resolution compared to the 
	silicon tracker and the lack of a measurement along the z axis. 
	This is the result of the large number of measurements and longer
	measured track length. In addition, the TRT provides extra ability to 
	identify elecctrons due to the polypropylene fibres (foils) in the barrel
	(end-cap) emit photons when a charged particle traverses the boundaries of
	the material. These photons are then absorbed by the Xenon gas mixture, which
	the intensity depends on gamma factor of the traversing particle. 
	This information can then be exploited for eletron/pion discrimination.

	\subsubsection{Calorimeter system}



	\begin{figure}[bht]

		\label{fig:calo}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}

	The ATLAS calorimeters~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-01}
	are sampling calorimeters, meaning
	different material are used for the absorber and the active part.
	A cut-away view of the calorimeters is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:calo}.
	These calorimeters cover the range $|\eta|$< 4.9, using 
	different techniques suited to the widely varying requirements 
	of the physics processes of interest and of the radiation environment
	over this large $\eta$-range. Over the $\eta$ region matched to 
	the inner detector, the fine granularity of	the EM calorimeter 
	is ideal for precision measurements of electrons and photons. The
	coarser granularity of the rest of the calorimeter is sufficient 
	for the jet reconstruction and $E_{miss}^T$ measurements.

	The electromagnetic and hadronic showers must be contained in the 
	calorimeter to avoid punch-through into the muon system. 
	The calorimeter depth is hence an important design consideration. 
	The total thickness of the EM calorimeter is greater than
	22 radiation lengths ($X_0$) in the barrel and greater than 
	24 $X_0$ in the end-caps. The approximate 9.7 interaction 
	lengths ($\lambda$) of active calorimeter in 
	the barrel ( $10\ \lambda$ in the end-caps) are adequate to 
	provide good resolution for high-energy jets. The total thickness, 
	including $1.3\ \lambda$ from the outer support, is $11\ \lambda$
	at $\eta$ = 0 and has been shown both by measurements and simulations 
	to be sufficient to reduce punch-through well below the irreducible 
	level of prompt or decay muons. Together with the large
	\mbox{$\eta$-coverage}, this thickness will also ensure a good $E_{miss}^T$ 
	measurement.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{LAr electromagnetic calorimeter} \\
		The EM calorimeter is a 
		lead-Liquid argon (lead-LAr) detector~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-02} with accordion-shaped kapton electrodes and lead 
		absorber plates over its full coverage. The accordion geometry provides 
		complete $\phi$ symmetry without azimuthal cracks. The lead thickness in 
		the absorber plates has been optimised as a function of $\eta$ in terms of EM calorimeter
		performance in energy resolution. 
		The EM calorimeter is divided into a barrel part ($|\eta| < 1.475$) 
		and two end-cap components ($1.375 < |\eta|< 3.2$), each housed 
		in their own cryostat.
		%  The position of the central solenoid in
		% front of the EM calorimeter demands optimisation of the material 
		% in order to achieve the desired calorimeter performance. As a consequence, 
		% the central solenoid and the LAr calorimeter share a common vacuum vessel, 
		% thereby eliminating two vacuum walls. 
		The barrel calorimeter
		consists of two identical half-barrels, separated by a small gap (4 mm) at z = 0. 
		Each end-cap calorimeter is mechanically divided into two coaxial wheels: 
		an outer wheel covering the region $1.375 < |\eta|< 2.5$, and an inner wheel 
		covering the region $2.5 < |\eta|< 3.2$.
		
		The calorimeter has three layers along the transverse direction:
		a pre-sampler with very high granularity in $\eta$, in order to 
		reconstruct the neutral pions decaying to two photons and particles 
		which already starts showering in the inner detector. 
		The pre-sampler is followed by longer towers of relatively 
		high granularity, which is the major part of detecting EM showers, 
		and reponsible for measuring the $\eta$ and $\phi$ coordinates of 
		the particles. The last layer detects showers generated from 
		particles other than electrons or photons that start showering 
		inside the EM calorimeter before leaving it.

		\item \textbf{Tile calorimeter} \\
		The tile calorimeter~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-03} is placed directly outside the EM calorimeter envelope. 
		Its	barrel covers the region $|\eta|< 1.0$, and its two extended barrels 
		the range $0.8 < |\eta|< 1.7$. It is a
		sampling calorimeter using steel as the absorber and scintillating tiles 
		as the active material. The	barrel and extended barrels are divided azimuthally 
		into 64 modules. 
		% Radially, the tile calorimeter
		% extends from an inner radius of 2.28 m to an outer radius of 4.25 m. 
		It is segmented in depth in three
		layers, approximately 1.5, 4.1 and 1.8 $\lambda$ 
		thick for the barrel and 1.5, 2.6, and
		3.3 $\lambda$ for the extended barrel. 
		The total detector thickness at the outer edge of the tile-instrumented
		region is 9.7 $\lambda$ at $\eta$ = 0. 
		% Two sides of the scintillating tiles are read out by wavelength shifting
		% fibres into two separate photomultiplier tubes. 
		% In $\eta$, the readout cells built by grouping fibres into
		% the photomultipliers are pseudo-projective towards the interaction region.
		\item  \textbf{LAr hadronic end-cap calorimeter} \\
		The Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) consists of two
		independent wheels per end-cap, located directly behind the end-cap 
		electromagnetic calorimeter and sharing the same LAr cryostats. 
		The HEC covers the range of $1.5< |\eta|< 3.2$, 
		slightly overlapping with the forward calorimeter which 
		will be described in the following paragraph 
		(around $|\eta|$= 3.1) and the tile calorimeter ($|\eta|< 1.7$).
		This overlap is to reduce the drop in material 
		density at the transition between
		the different calorimeters.
		% Each wheel is built from 32
		% identical wedge-shaped modules, assembled with fixtures at the periphery 
		% and at the central bore.
		% Each wheel is divided into two segments in depth, for a total of four 
		% layers per end-cap. The wheels
		% closest to the interaction point are built from 25 mm parallel copper plates, 
		% while those further away
		% use 50 mm copper plates (for all wheels the first plate is half-thickness). 
		% The outer radius of the
		% copper plates is 2.03 m, while the inner radius is 0.475 m 
		% (except in the overlap region with the
		% forward calorimeter where this radius becomes 0.372 m). 
		% The copper plates are interleaved with
		% 8.5 mm LAr gaps, providing the active medium for this sampling calorimeter.
		\item  \textbf{LAr forward calorimeter}\\
		The Forward Calorimeter (FCal) covers $3.1 < |\eta| < 4.9 $ and
		%  is integrated into the end-cap cryostats, 
		% as this provides clear benefits in terms of uniformity of the calorimetric 
		% coverage as well as reduced radiation background levels in the muon spectrometer. 
		% In order to reduce the amount of neutron albedo in the inner detector cavity, 
		% the front face of the FCal is recessed by about 1.2 m with respect to the EM calorimeter 
		% front face. This severely limits the depth of the calorimeter
		% and therefore calls for a high-density design. The FCal 
		is approximately 10 interaction lengths deep. 
		It consists of three modules in each end-cap: 
		the first, made of copper, is optimised for	electromagnetic measurements, 
		while the other two, made of tungsten, measure predominantly the
		energy of hadronic interactions. 
		Due to high particle fluxes and
		energies in the forward region, the calorimeter must contain 
		relatively long showers in the small volume
		allowed by design constraints, and thus must be very dense.
		% Each module consists of a metal matrix, 
		% with regularly spaced longitudinal channels filled with the electrode structure 
		% consisting of concentric rods and tubes	parallel to the beam axis. 
		% The LAr in the gap between the rod and the tube is the sensitive medium.
		% This geometry allows for excellent control of the gaps, which are as small 
		% as 0.25 mm in the first
		% section, in order to avoid problems due to ion buildup.

	\subsubsection{Muon Spectrometer}
	
	\begin{figure}[bht]

		\label{fig:MS}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	The muon spectrometer (MS)~\cite{ATLAS-TDR-11} is the 
	outermost and largest detector of ATLAS. 
	The cut-away view of the MS is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:MS}.
	It fully covers the	calorimeter system and occupies a large part of the ATLAS cavern. 
	It is based on the magnetic deflection of muon tracks in the 
	large superconducting air-core toroid magnets, instrumented with
	separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers. 
	Over the range $|\eta|< 1.4$, magnetic bending is provided by the large 
	barrel toroid. For $1.6 < |\eta|< 2.7$, muon tracks are bent by two smaller
	end-cap magnets inserted into both ends of the barrel toroid. 
	Over $1.4 < |\eta|< 1.6$, usually referred to as the transition region, 
	magnetic deflection is provided by a combination of barrel and end-cap
	fields. The configuration of magnets provides a field mostly orthogonal 
	to the muon trajectories, hence minimising the degradation of 
	resolution due to multiple scattering. 
	% The anticipated high level of 
	% particle flux has had a major impact on the choice and design of the spectrometer 
	% instrumentation, affecting performance parameters such as rate capability, granularity, ageing
	% properties, and radiation hardness.
	% In the barrel region, tracks are measured in chambers arranged in three cylindrical layers
	% around the beam axis; in the transition and end-cap regions, the chambers are installed in planes
	% perpendicular to the beam, also in three layers.


	The MS measures momentum of muons tracks depends on the momentum 
	of the tracks. 
	The resolution is typically 2–3\% over most of the kinematic range
	apart from very high momenta, where it increases to about 10\% at \pt\ = 1 TeV.  
	The MS consists of four subsystems which rely on four different gas detector
	technologies. Two of them, the resistive plate chambers (RPC) in the barrel region 
	and the thin gap chambers (TGC) in the end-cap region, provide trigger signals, 
	while the other two, the monitored drift tubes (MDT) and the cathode strip 
	chambers (CSC) provide the momentum measurement. The MDT chambers provide high 
	precision measurements in the bending direction over most of the detector
	acceptance while the CSC are used in the forward region where the particle flux 
	is too high for the MDT	chambers. The muon chambers are arranged in the barrel 
	($|\eta| < 1.05$) in three cylindrical layers around the beam axis, 
	while in the end-cap regions ($1.05 < |\eta| < 2.7$) they are placed in three wheels.

	\subsubsection{Trigger system}
	\begin{figure}[bht]
		\begin{centering}	
		\includegraphics[width=.97\textwidth]{Detector_plots/summary xs.png}
		\caption{Plot showing the production cross-sections of the most dominant
		background processes at the LHC.}
		\label{fig:summary production Xs}
		\end{centering}
	\end{figure}
	As mentioned in section \ref{sec:runs and results}, the spacing of each bunch
	is 25 ns. This translates to a frequency of 40 MHz of bunch crossing. It
	will be difficult and not meaningful to keep all these events, which includes
	a lot of ``uninteresting'' physics events. Figure~\ref{fig:summary production Xs} 
	shows a summary of the most dominant background processes production cross-sections.
	Many of these processes produce high multiplicity of jets and are not of experimental
	interest. Therefore, it's necessary to adopts a trigger system that make fast decisions
	whether to save the event or not.
	The ATLAS trigger system consists of two consecutive parts: the Level 1 trigger
	\cite{ATLAS-TDR-12}, followed by the Level 2 and the event filter, 
	which together form the High Level Trigger (HLT)
	\cite{ATLAS-TDR-16}.
	
	The L1 trigger searches for signatures from high-\pt\ muons, electrons/photons, jets, and 
	\mbox{$\tau$-leptons} decaying into hadrons. It also selects events with large MET
	and large total transverse energy. The L1 trigger uses reduced-granularity information from a
	subset of detectors: the RPC and TGC for high-\pt\ muons, and all the calorimeter 
	sub-systems for electromagnetic clusters, jets, $\tau$-leptons, $E_{miss}^T$ ,
	and large total transverse energy.
	As a result, the L1 trigger reduces the event rate from 40 MHz to a maximum of 100 kHz.
	The decision is made by Central Trigger	Processor (CTP), 
	which operates on signals from dedicated hardware in the calorimeter
	and muon detector systems. The decision time, at under 2.5 $\mu s$, is faster than the ID
	can process events so ID information is omitted.
	For each data-taking period, the L1	trigger is loaded with a trigger menu, 
	a list of up to 256 criteria used to determine
	whether an event is accepted. The trigger menus are designed to accomodate a broad
	physics programme, with high acceptance for both BSM searches and SM precision
	measurements.

	The L1 trigger also uses detector information with reduced granularity to identify Regions
	of Interest (RoI)~\cite{Blair:2007qn} in $\phi$ and $\eta$.
	The L2 selection is seeded by the RoI information provided by the L1 trigger over a dedicated
	data path. L2 selections use, at full granularity and precision, all the available detector 
	data within the RoI’s.
	The L2 menus are designed to reduce the
	trigger rate to approximately 3.5 kHz, with an event processing time of about 40 ms,
	averaged over all events. The final stage of the event selection is carried out by 
	the event filter, which reduces the event rate to roughly 200 Hz. 
	The selections are implemented using offline analysis procedures
	within an average event processing time of the order of four seconds.
