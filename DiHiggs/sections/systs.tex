This section describes the systematic uncertainties in the HH analysis.

Systematic uncertainties arise from experimental sources related to the detector response and the object reconstruction and identification of the various physics objects and from modelling unceratinties that include theoretical uncertainties related to our knowledge of the MC simulated processes and uncertainties on data-driven backgrounds. Both experimental and modelling uncertainties affect the predictions of both the backgrounds and signals. These uncertainties manifest themselves as uncertainties in the overall yield and in the shape of the final observable (the MVA score distributions). All these uncertainties are propagated through the analysis and are included in the statistical analysis fit described in Section~\ref{sec:fit}.
