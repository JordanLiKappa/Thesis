This section describes the background estimation methods used in the HH analysis. 

The simulated event samples summarised in Section~\ref{sec:data_backgrounds} are used to model all background processes, except for processes with fake-\tauhad which are estimated using data-driven techniques, as discussed below. In the \lephad channel, all fake-\tauhad backgrounds from $t\bar{t}$ and multi-jet processes are estimated using an inclusive fake-factor method, described in Section~\ref{subsec:LepHadfake}. In the \hadhad channel, the multijet background is estimated using a data-driven fake-factor method as described in Section~\ref{subsec:HadHadmultijet} and the $t\bar{t}$ background with fake-\tauhad is estimated using a scale-factor method with scale-factors derived from data to correct the MC prediction as described in Section~\ref{sec:ttbarfake_hadhad_sf_method}.

Separate estimation techniques are used for fake \tauhad from
multi-jet and \ttbar processes, since a combined approach is difficult
in the \hadhad-channel where multi-jet features two fake-\tauhad while
typically only a single fake-\tauhad is present in \ttbar. Moreover,
the presence of HLT \tauhad identification due to the \hadhad trigger
selection (cf.~\Cref{sec:hadhad_trigger_selection}) and the
requirement of at least one loose \tauhad in the derivation skim
introduces difficulties in combined estimation procedures. The larger
uncertainties, as compared to a combined approach, are not causing any
degradation of the results due the statistical limitation of the Run 2
analysis.

The \ttbar with true-\tauhad and Z+HF templates are taken from the MC prediction but their normalisations are derived from data as included as freely floating parameters in the final fit, as described in Section~\ref{sec:fit}. 

Events with electrons or muons that are misidentified as \tauhad\ objects, dominantly coming from the \ttbar\ production, represent a minor background in the analysis and they are estimated from simulation. This background is treated together with the \ttbar\ events containing true-\tauhad\ objects. Additional material can be found in Appendix~\ref{subsec:appendix_bkg_leptons_faking_taus}.
