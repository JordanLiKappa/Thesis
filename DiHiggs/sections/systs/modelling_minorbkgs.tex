Cross-section uncertainties are applied to all MC-based backgrounds. For minor backgrounds as single-top (s- and t-channels), Z+lf, W+jets and Diboson, acceptance uncertaintieas are only applied on the normalisation and their size is taken from the estimation performed in the SM VHbb analysis~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2020-006, AlKhoury:2690042}.  On single-top production an acceptance uncertainty of 20\% is applied  in the s- and t-channels. An acceptance uncertainty of 23\% is applied on Z+lf. On W+jets an acceptance uncertainty of 37\% is applied in the \lephad channel while a 50\% is applied in the \hadhad channel in order to cover in addition for the fake-$\tau$ contribution (the uncertainty on the $\tau$-fakes in W+jets was estimated comparing the MC and the data-driven prediction for W+jets fakes in the 0btags region of the \lephad channel to be 31\% in the previous iteration of this analsysis). Acceptance uncertainties of 25\%, 26\% and 20\% are applied on WW, WZ and ZZ respectively.
