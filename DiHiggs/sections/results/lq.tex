\subsection{Exclusion contours on the LQ mass as a function of B}

The limits on cross-section and mass for a fixed value of $B$, branching ratio decaying into charged lepton, that is expected 
to have the highest sensitivity for the respective analysis.  Figure~ shows the limits on the LQ mass as a function of B for our signature. 
The region on the left of the contour lines is excluded at 95\% confidence level. 
The strongest limits in terms of mass exclusion are for $LQ_3^{\mathrm{u}}$ for $B=1$ in $bb\tau\tau$ channel. 

The exclusion contours for up-type leptoquarks are made using $\beta = 1.0$ signal samples which are scaled to the target branching 
ratio begin scanned in the 2D plane. This choice is due to the reweighted $\beta=0.5$ and scaled $\beta=1$ limits being fully compatible.
