All events are subjected to the standard ATLAS event cleaning procedure, following the recommendations of the \href{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/DataPreparationCheckListForPhysicsAnalysis}{\underline{DataPrep group}}.
Data events must be part of the runs listed in the GRLs as described in Section~\ref{sec:data}. 
A veto is applied to the following bad or corrupted events:
\begin{itemize}
\item LAr noise burst and data corruption (xAOD::EventInfo::LAr),
\item Tile corrupted events (xAOD::EventInfo::Tile),
\item events affected by the SCT recovery procedure for single event upsets (xAOD::EventInfo::SCT),
\item incomplete events (xAOD::EventInfo::Core).
\end{itemize}

Events are required to have a primary vertex with at least two associated tracks. The primary vertex is selected as the one with the largest $\sum \pT^2$, where the sum is over all tracks with transverse momentum \pt > 0.5 GeV that are associated with the vertex.
