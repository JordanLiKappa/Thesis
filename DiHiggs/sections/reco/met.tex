The missing transverse momentum is reconstructed as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of leptons, hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons and jets, calculated using the fully calibrated physics objects described above, and as a ‘soft term’ calculated as the vectorial sum of the \pt\ of tracks matched to the primary vertex but not associated to a reconstructed lepton or jet~\cite{Aaboud:2018tkc}. The magnitude of the missing transverse momentum vector ir referred to as \MET.
