\paragraph*{Version 0.9}

This version contains all the updates presented at the PAM.

Open item:

\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate global significance with toys.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Version 0.8}

This version contains all the updates requested at the HDBS group approval and for the 1st circulation to ATLAS.

Few minor open items:

\begin{itemize}
\item Include 375 GeV mass point for limit calculation (sample is ready, missing modelling shape systs for the bkg at this mass point);
\item Update ggF signal cross section uncertainties when new recommendations announced by LHCHH WG;
\item Calculate global significance with toys.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Version 0.7}

This version contains the updated results for HDBS group approval.

There are a few small open items to be updated:

\begin{itemize}
\item Include 375 GeV mass point for resonant limit calculation (when sample is ready);
\item Add VBF non-resonant signal acceptance uncertainties in the \lephad channel;
\item Fix bug in PS uncertainty (shape and norm) for the resonant signal in the \lephad channel;
\item Fix CP syst for the diboson bkg in the \lephad channel;
\item Update ggF signal cross section uncertainties when new recommendations announced by LHCHH WG.
\item Add a resonant signal uncertainty to cover the difference between FullSim and AF2 for \tauhad trigger.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Version 0.6}

This version contains the unblinded results for the individual channel and the combination and addresses
the CDS comments we received for the unblinding approval.


\paragraph*{Version 0.5}
This version contains the individual fit results for the \lephad and \hadhad channels with all updates relevant for the 
unblinding approval. The Z+HF inputs are re-done removing the \ttbar reweighing in the Z+HF CR. The \lephad and
\hadhad fits are repeated with the updated Z+HF CR inputs. The results for \lephad are updated in this version.
For \hadhad we checked only the SM non-resonant case due to the time constraints and found only minor differences.
That is discussed at the EB meeting on April 30th. We will update the \hadhad results in v0.6. 

Main updates compared to the previous version of the HH analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item unblinding criteria for the SM MVAs and corresponding plots
\item updated single top modelling uncertainties
\item updated \lephad fit results and non-resonant limits
\item updated \lephad prefit/postfit PNN/NN input variable distributions
\item added \lephad prefit/postfit PNN/NN distributions in 1-tag region
\item updated bin edges used for \lephad MVA plots
\item updated \hadhad close-to-SR plots with new blinding criterion
\item Z+HF systematic closure plots in the \hadhad channel
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Version 0.4}

This is the version containing the individual fit results for the lephad and hadhad channels with all updates relevant for the unblinding approval. We found that the Z+HF inputs
are done with the ttbar reweighting, so we need to re-make them and update all results before the unblinding as well (Z+HF CR is used also in the individual fits). 

Main updates compared to the previous version of the HH analysis (status April 24):
\begin{itemize}
\item added missing minor systematics for non-resonant HH signal and ZHtatau (lephad+hadhad)
\item updated top bkg modelling systematics (lephad+hadhad)
\item updated yield tables for new inputs, yield tables in the 3 last MVA bins (lephad+hadhad)
\item improved MVA optimisation descriptions (lephad+hadhad)
\item adding cross check of compatibility of lephad FFs and hadhad SFs for fake bkg
\item added description of the smoothing cross checks
\item updated Z+HF CR fit description
\item adding bkg validation for SR-like or VR regions with a cut on MVA score (hadhad+hadhad)
\item adding correlation tests 
\item updated Z+HF syst section
\item updated fit results (lephad+hadhad)
\item updated systematics table
\item updated lephad trigger tables
\item updated lephad fake plots
\item extended lephad signal up to 1.6 TeV
\item updated ttbar fake SFs (adding trigger SFs) for hadhad
\item addressing STT inefficiency comment (hadhad)
\item added motivation for hadhad trigger selection
\end{itemize}

There are still some open items summarised below.
\begin{itemize}
\item new Z+HF CR inputs without ttbar reweighting
\item lephad, hadhad and the combined results with the new inputs
\item investigate if further unblinding in the SM MVA score possible 
\end{itemize}

%\paragraph*{Version 0.3}
%
%This is the third version of the note. 
%
%This version is now including the remaining plots and checks requested for the HH analysis from the EB comments on v 0.1 and it is also including an updated description of the HH fit setup and fit results. Comments on v 0.2 and from the last two EB meeting will be addressed in the next version of the note.
%
%%This version also includes an updated description of the LQLQ analysis. 
%
%Main updates compared to the previous version on the HH analysis:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Updated description of the OLR: the OLR used for the analysis is not performed using
%b-jet aware jet-electron / jet-muon removal as previously wrongly stated in the note. The ``standard OLR''
%(recommended by the flavour tagging group) is used instead. However,
%the jet-\tauhad / anti-\tauhad OLR is still b-jet aware as stated in
%the note.
%\item Added in appendix (referenced from selection section) description of acceptance x efficiency improvement compared to previous analysis for the \hadhad channel.
%\item Added data/prediction plots of \hadhad trigger objects and MVA input variables split by data-taking period.
%\item Added background estimation validation plots for \hadhad including all systematics and additionally plots of the MVA scores in more validation regions and also split by trigger.
%\item Switched from $\eta$-inclusive Multijet FFs in \hadhad to two
%  $\eta$ bins to resolve observed non-closure and mismodelling in the
%  fake validation region. This change was implemented to improve
%  agreement in the validation region and is not expected to have a
%  significant impact on the 2-tag signal region. This change is
%  implemented in the main body and additional material is collected in
%  \Cref{app:pseudorapidity_dependence_fake_factors}.
%\item Updated fit setup section.
%\item Updated fit results section.
%\end{itemize}
%

%%      on ttbar fake MC subtraction (related to anti-ID ttbar fake SF)
%%\item plots are added in results section.
%%\end{itemize}
%
%There are still some open items summarised below.
%
%General:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Signal cut-flows will be added soon for all channels.
%\end{itemize}
%
%HH analysis:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Trigger studies for the \hadhad channel will be added to the appendix.
%\item Add missing small backgrounds (ttV and ggZHtautau).
%\item Switch to Pythia8 non-resonant SM sample as nominal (and use Herwig one for systematic uncertainty).
%\item Single lepton triggers in the \lephad channel are updated in the analysis framework (msonly and e300\_etcut triggers are removed after checking with experts). The trigger table will be updated accordingly when the event yields are updated. Some small changes are expected in the \lephad event yields due to the updates in the framework.
%\item New \lephad channel CxAOD production to fix some issues in the previous one (fix of technical issue in some CP systematics and removed non-recommended triggers).
%\end{itemize}
%
%%LQ analysis:

%\paragraph*{Version 0.2}
%
%This is the second version of the note. Most of the EB comments on v0.1 have been addressed and implemented in this version of the note for the HH analysis. 
%
%
%Main updates compared to the previous version on the HH analysis:
%
%\begin{itemize}

%
%
%There are still some open items summarised below.

%\item More background validation plots for the HadHad channel will be added.

%\end{itemize}
%
%\underline{Notice:} Due to a configuration issue in the
%CxAODFramework, the OLR used for the analysis is not performed using
%b-jet aware jet-electron / jet-muon removal. The ``standard OLR''
%(recommended by the flavour tagging group) is used instead. However,
%the jet-\tauhad / anti-\tauhad OLR is still b-jet aware as stated in
%the note. We want to understand the implications of this
%misconfiguration and as a result have not updated the note concerning
%this issue. An update will be provided as soon as the impact of this
%issue understood.
