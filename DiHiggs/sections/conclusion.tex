A search for SM non-resonant and BSM resonant Higgs boson pair production in $b\bar b\tau^+\tau^-$ events is performed, where the resonant signal corresponds to a narrow scalar with a mass in the range 251 to 1600~\GeV. The $pp$ collision dataset used was collected between 2015 and 2018, and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $139~\text{fb}^{-1}$. This improves on the previous ATLAS search in this channel~\cite{HIGG-2016-16} by increasing the size of the dataset by nearly a factor of four, introducing superior $\tau$-lepton ($b$-jet) identification (identification and reconstruction) algorithms, and using improved multivariate classification strategies and methods for estimating the backgrounds from hadronic jets misidentified as $\tau$-leptons. The observed results are found to be compatible with the background-only hypothesis, with the largest deviation in the resonant search corresponding to a local (global) significance of 3.05 (2.05)$\sigma$ at 1~\TeV. These results exclude non-resonant Higgs boson pair production with a cross section above 4.65 times the SM prediction at the 95\% CL, the expected exclusion is 3.87 times the SM prediction. Observed (expected) upper limits are placed at the 95\% CL on resonant Higgs boson production cross sections above 23--920 (12--840) fb, depending on the mass of the resonance.
