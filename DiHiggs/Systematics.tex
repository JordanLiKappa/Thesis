The systematics considered in the $HH$ analysis
is outlined in this section. For the same reason 
mentioned in section~\ref{sec:FTAG_systematics}, 
the systematic uncertainties can be broadly catergorised
into experimental and modelling systematic uncertainties. 
The former arise from experimental sources related to the detector 
response and the physics object reconstruction and identification,
while the modelling systematic uncertainties account for 
theoretical uncertainties related to the limited 
knowledge of the MC simulated processes 
and uncertainties on data-driven backgrounds. 
The experimental and modelling uncertainties are derived for 
all backgrounds and signals, manifesting the overall yields
or the shape of the final discriminant, or both together.
All uncertainties considered are propagated through the analysis,
and are included in the statistical analysis fit
discussed in section~\ref{} TODO: ref fit section.
