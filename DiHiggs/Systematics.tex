\section{Systematic uncertainties}
The systematics considered in the $HH$ analysis
is outlined in this section. For the same reason 
mentioned in section~\ref{sec:FTAG_systematics}, 
the systematic uncertainties can be broadly catergorised
into experimental and modelling systematic uncertainties. 
The former arise from experimental sources related to the detector 
response and the physics object reconstruction and identification,
while the modelling systematic uncertainties account for 
theoretical uncertainties related to the limited 
knowledge of the MC simulated processes 
and uncertainties on data-driven backgrounds. 

The experimental systematic uncertainties have been 
briefly discussed in section~\ref{sec:FTAG_systematics},
while many of the systematics considered there will
be included in this analysis as well. 
In table~\ref{tab:systematics_experimental_list} 
and table~\ref{tab:systematics_experimental_list_2}, the full list
of the experimental systematics are listed, 
which will be discussed in more details in the following section.  

The experimental and modelling uncertainties are derived for 
all backgrounds and signals, manifesting the overall yields
or the shape of the final discriminant, or both together.
All uncertainties considered are propagated through the analysis,
and are included in the statistical analysis fit
discussed in section~\ref{sec:DiHiggs:results}.

\subsection{Summary of Systematics Uncertainties}

In Figure~\ref{fig:LepHadPostfitNPRankingsSM},
the rankings of the nuisance parameters considered in the
combined fit of SLT and LTT (more details in the next section~\ref{sec:DiHiggs:analysis}) 
are shown. The nuisance parameters are arranged in descending order
of their fractional impact on the non-resonant $HH$ production signal strength $\mu$,
$\Delta\mu/\Delta\mu_{tot}$. The $\Delta\mu/\Delta\mu_{tot}$ is represented in
the horizontal bars in the plot with values reading on the top blue x-axis, with the 
dashed (un-dashed) blue area representing the frational impact on $\mu$ 
when the nuisance parameter is varied up (down) by one standard deviation (with
this parameter fixed to the variation and fit again allowing all other nuisance parameters to 
vary). The black round dots reading on the bottom x-axis, 
represent the shift of the fitted value $\theta$
from its nominal value $\theta_0$, with respect to its standard deviation $\Delta\theta$.
The error bars corresponding to the dots are the fitted uncertainties, relative to 
the nominal uncertainties.  The red open circle reading on the bottom x-axis
represents the fitted value 
of the \ttbar\ and \ZHF\ normalisation which are freely floating in the fit,
with the error bars representing the uncertainty. 
The statistical uncertainty is also included as nuisance parameters with Poissonian priors.
The name `LepHad\_SLT(LTT)\_SR\_MVA\_bin\_14' represents the statistical error on 
the $14^{th}$ bin in the SM NN score distribution.
