\section{Trigger and event Selection}



\label{sec:DiHiggs:selection}



Events in the $\tau_\text{lep}\tau_\text{had}$ categories 
are recorded using a combination of single-lepton triggers (SLTs) 
and lepton-plus-$\tau_\text{had-vis}$ triggers (LTTs). 
The SLTs require an electron or muon to be reconstructed 
at the HLT with a minimum \pt\ threshold that 
ranges from 24~GeV to 26~GeV for electrons and 
a minimum \pt\ threshold that 
ranges from 20~GeV to 26~GeV for muons, 
depending on the data-taking period. 
The LTTs require that an electron with \pt $>17$~GeV 
or a muon with \pt$>14$~GeV in addition to 
a $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ with \pt$>25$~GeV are reconstructed at the HLT. 
% From the 2017 data-taking period onward, 
% for the LTTs that rely on an electron at the HLT or 
% a $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ with a \pt\ threshold below 35~GeV, 
% either an additional jet with \pt $>25~\text{GeV}$ or 
% two additional jets with \pt $>12~\text{GeV}$ are required 
% at the Level-1 trigger to reduce the trigger rates. 
% To ensure that the trigger reaches its efficiency plateau, 
% the offline electrons, muons and $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ objects 
% are required to be within $\Delta R<0.07$, $\Delta R<0.1$ 
% and $\Delta R<0.2$ of the corresponding objects at the HLT, respectively. 
Minimum \pt\ thresholds are applied to the offline objects, 
which are 1~GeV above the thresholds for electrons and muons at the HLT, 
5~GeV above the thresholds for $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ at the HLT, 
and 80~GeV (45~GeV) for jets with 
Level-1 trigger \pt-thresholds of 25~GeV (12~GeV). 
Events which pass the offline SLT lepton \pt\ requirements 
are not considered for the LTT to ensure no overlap with the SLT category. 
These two categories are analysed separately.




\subsection{Event pre-selection}

\label{sec:DiHiggs:selection}



Before passing the events to the MVA algorithm, they are required to pass a loose
pre-selection criteria. 
Events are required to contain exactly 
one electron or muon, 
an oppositely charged $\tau_\text{had-vis}$, 
and exactly two $b$-tagged jets.
The selected electron (muon) must pass a 
tight (medium) identification requirement with an efficiency of around 80\% (97\%).
% and the (sub-)leading $b$-tagged jet is required to have \pt$>45~(20)$~GeV. 
The invariant mass of the $\tau$-lepton pair ($m_{\tau\tau}^\text{MMC}$) 
is estimated from the four-momenta of the electron or muon, 
the $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ and the \met\ 
using the Missing Mass Calculator (MMC)~\cite{Elagin:2010aw}, 
which assumes that the \met\ is exclusively from the neutrinos 
produced in the $\tau$-lepton decays. 
To reject background events from low-mass Drell-Yan events, $m_{\tau\tau}^\text{MMC}$ is required to be above 60~GeV.
The $b$-tagged jet pair invariant mass ($m_{bb}$) is required to be less than 150~GeV 
to reject $t\bar t$ background events, and to allow for the definition of 
a $t\bar t$-enriched region which is used in the estimation of $t\bar t$ backgrounds, 
as described in Section~\ref{sec:DiHiggs:lephadfake}. 
A $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ with $\pt>20$~GeV and 
$\vert\eta\vert<2.3$ is required in the SLT category, 
and a $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ with $\pt>30$~GeV, 
or higher if required by the trigger, 
and $\vert\eta\vert<2.3$ is required in the LTT category. 
In both categories, the (sub-)leading $b$-tagged jet 
must have $\tau_pt>45~(20)$~GeV, 
in addition to any trigger-dependent requirements.
The full event pre-selection is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:DiHiggs:selectionsummary}.

The rate of events accepted by the detector is quantified by the \textit{acceptance},
and the rate of events selected by the analysis selection is quantified by 
the \textit{selection efficiency}.
These two rates are usually multiplied together ($A \times \epsilon$) to quantify the rate of a simulated event
accepted by the detector and the analysis selection. 
The cumulative $A \times \epsilon$ in each step of the pre-selection
is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:DiHiggs:cutflowslt}
and Table~\ref{tab:DiHiggs:cutflowltt}
for the SLT and LTT channels, respectively, for the
non-resonant signal and three example resonances mass points.

The $A \times \epsilon$ for all resonances mass points are shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:selection:acceptances}. 
The decrease in $A \times \epsilon$ 
for $m_X$ greater than about 1000~GeV is due to the Lorentz boost 
of the Higgs bosons causing their decay products to become highly collimated more often.

\subsection{Anti--$\tau_{had}$ selection: TODO: should I put this section in here or in analysis chapter?}
Anti--$\tau_{had}$ objects are selected only in events 
in which there are fewer $\tau_{had}$ that pass the offline $\tau_{had}$--ID than
required for a given channel (one for the $\tau_{lep}\tau_{had}$ 
and two for the $\tau_{had}$$\tau_{had}$ selection). 
In that case, additional anti--$\tau_{had}$ candidates are selected 
so that the total number of selected $\tau_{had}$ (loose, which always has priority,
and anti--$\tau_{had}$) corresponds to the required multiplicity in each channel.
For channels where $\tau_{had}$--ID is applied at trigger level 
(more details in Section~\ref{sec:event selection}), 
only the anti--$\tau_{had}$ objects that are matched to the
trigger $\tau_{had}$ are considered, and thus there are 
no multiple selection possibilities. 
However, for channels where a $\tau_{had}$ trigger is not used, 
an anti--$\tau_{had}$ candidate is chosen randomly when there are more reconstructed
$\tau_{had}$ satisfying the anti--$\tau_{had}$ definition. 
Any anti--$\tau_{had}$ objects that are not selected in this process are also not
considered when performing the overlap removal of detector objects, 
which is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:overlap}.


\section{Multivariate signal extraction}
\label{sec:DiHiggs:MVA}

% Multivariate discriminants (MVAs) evaluated on events 
% passing the above selections are used to extract possible signals. 
% Parameterised neural networks (PNNs) are used 
% in the search for resonant $HH$ production, and neural networks (NNs) 
% are used in the search for non-resonant $HH$. 

% During training, the sum of all backgrounds normalised to
% their respective cross-sections is used. 
% The backgrounds containing fake-$\tau_\text{had-vis}$ 
% are modelled using MC simulation. 
% The PNNs are parameterised in the mass of the heavy resonance, 
% providing near-optimal sensitivity and continuity over 
% the range of signal masses considered. 
% The hyperparameters were optimised separately for each MVA 
% using a random scan followed by a Bayesian optimisation procedure. 
% % The 375~GeV resonant $HH$ signal is not used in the PNN trainings. 
% %Additionally, the PNNs interpolate well between the mass points used for the training.% The background does not have a well defined value of the heavy resonance or LQ mass, so during training the background events are assigned a random value from the signal parameter values. Maybe mention that NNs are optimal / sufficient statistic?. , where a single binary classifier is not optimal for all signal masses. without major loss of sensitivity, allowing results to be quoted for masses other than those used during training
The same set of MVA input variables is used for the resonant and non-resonant production modes, 
though different input variables are used for the SLT and LTT channels. 
These variables are listed in Table~\ref{tab:selection:mvas:HHinputs}, and are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $m_{HH}$ is the invariant mass of the $HH$ system 
as reconstructed from the $\tau$-lepton pair (calculated using the MMC) and the $b$-tagged jet pair;
\item $\Delta R(\tau, \tau)$ is evaluated between the two $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ 
(the electron or muon and the $\tau_\text{had-vis}$) 
in the $\tau_\text{had}\tau_\text{had}$ category ($\tau_\text{lep}\tau_\text{had}$ categories);
\item $\Delta R(b, b)$ is evaluated between the $b$-tagged jets;
\item $\Delta p_\text{T}(\ell, \tau)$ is the difference 
between the transverse momenta of the lepton and the $\tau_\text{had-vis}$;
\item $m_\text{T}^W =\sqrt{2p_\text{T}^\ell E_\text{T}^\text{miss}(1-\cos\Delta\phi_{\ell,E_\text{T}^\text{miss}})}$ 
is the transverse mass of the lepton and the \met;
\item the $E_\text{T}^\text{miss}~\phi$ centrality specifies 
the angular position of the $E_\text{T}^{\text{miss}}$ 
relative to the $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ in the transverse plane~\cite{HIGG-2013-32} 
and is defined as $(A+B)/\sqrt{A^2+B^2}$, 
where $A=\sin(\phi_{E_\text{T}^\text{miss}}-\phi_{\tau_2})/\sin(\phi_{\tau_1}-\phi_{\tau_2})$,
$B=\sin(\phi_{\tau_1}-\phi_{\mathrm{E}_\text{T}^\text{miss}})/\sin(\phi_{\tau_1}-\phi_{\tau_2})$, 
and $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ represent the two $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ 
(electron or muon and $\tau_\text{had-vis}$) in the case of 
the $\tau_\text{had}\tau_\text{had}$ category ($\tau_\text{lep}\tau_\text{had}$ categories);
\item $\Delta\phi(\ell\tau, bb)$ is the azimuthal angle between the $\ell+\tau_\text{had-vis}$ system and the $b$-tagged jet pair;
\item $\Delta\phi(\ell, E_\text{T}^\text{miss})$ is the 
azimuthal angle between the lepton and the \met\;
\item $\Delta\phi(\ell\tau, E_\text{T}^\text{miss})$ is the 
azimuthal angle between the electron or muon and $\tau_\text{had-vis}$ system and the \met\;
\item $S_\text{T}$ is the total transverse energy in the event, summed over all jets, 
$\tau_\text{had-vis}$ and leptons in the event and \pt $^\text{miss}$.%sum of hadronic energy in the event transverse to the beamline;
\end{itemize}
%% Signal events tend to have a lower $m_\text{T}^W$ than the $t\bar t$ process because the transverse mass of a lepton and neutrino decaying from a $W$~boson in a $t\bar t$ event tends to peak at $m_W\approx 80~\text{GeV}$.
% The $m_{HH}$, $m_{\tau\tau}^\text{MMC}$ and $m_{bb}$ distributions are shown 
% in Figure~\ref{fig:selection:mvas:mHHmMMCmbb}. 
% For all categories of the non-resonant search, 
% $m_{\tau\tau}^\text{MMC}$ and $m_{bb}$ are among 
% the three most important MVA input variables. 
% For the resonant search, five values of $m_X$ were tested in all categories, 
% and $m_{HH}$ was found to be the most important MVA input variable in all cases 
% except for at lower values of $m_X$ in the $\tau_\text{had}\tau_\text{had}$ category.

The non-resonant SM signal is well-defined in its kinematic properties, and so a 
neural network trained on this signal is used.
The resonant signal, however, is not a single signal hypothesis, 
but rather a set of continuous signal hypotheses parameterised by 
the mass of the heavy resonance which decays to Higgs boson pairs.
For these cases, a standard binary classification algorithm is not optimal. 
A set of single discriminants trained on each of the simulated signal hypotheses 
would provide good discrimination for the simulated hypotheses, 
but can not interpolate well between these points. 
For this reason, and to reduce the number of algorithms that require training, 
Parametric Neural Networks (PNNs)~\cite{Baldi:2016fzo} are used 
for the extraction of the resonant signal. PNNs are neural networks 
which enable optimal signal-to-background classification
for signal spectra connected by one or more physics parameters. 
As this problem is a smoothly-varying learning task, 
the PNN is not just able to learn how to classify signals at the simulated signal mass training
points, but also how to interpolate between them. 
To check the mass resolution of the interpolation, 
the PNN response in terms of Asimov significance as a function of the PNN mass
parameter is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MVA:mass-response}. 
The minimum significance appears in the vicinity of low signal masses, reaching a 
value of 0.7. As the signal mass increases, the `gap' becomes smaller and smaller.
The PNN therefore covers the whole scanning mass spectrum with very high significance.

% This is showing the mass resolution of the PNN.

efficiency of the \lephad\ channel signal region selection depending on the mass of the resonance, 
all significances are scaled so that the maximum significance is 1 for better visibility.}

In both NN used for non-resonant signal and PNNs used for resonant signal,
the three most significant and discriminating variables are
$m_{HH}$, $m_{\tau\tau}^\text{MMC}$ and $m_{bb}$. 
The data versus MC distributions of these three variables are shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:MVAvariables}. 
The distributions of the other MVA variables are shown in Appendix~\ref{}TODO: add plots in Appendix.

    Showing the data versus MC distributions of the three most significant and discriminating variables, 
    $m_{HH}$, $m_{\tau\tau}^\text{MMC}$ and $m_{bb}$, after the pre-selection and before applying the fit.  
    The top (bottom) row is showing the variables in the SLT (LTT) channel. 
    The non-resonant Di-Higgs signal is also included in the plots, and it is 
    scaled by a factor of 2000 (1000) for the SLT (LTT) to make it more visible. 
    The visible discrepancy between the data and MC is mostly due to the normalisation

    constrain the normalisation of the \ttbar\ and the Z + heavy flavour jets background

% The (P)NNs are trained using Keras~\cite{chollet2015keras} 
% with the Tensorflow~\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} backend. 
% The PNNs used in the analyses described in this note take as an input parameter to specify which signal
% should be targeted, along side the feature variables, the heavy resonance mass for the di-Higgs analysis.
% During training, the PNNs are trained on all the signals simultaneously, and are provided with the
% generator-level masses of the signals and a random mass from the distribution of simulated signal masses
% for the background. The background events are provided with such distribution of simulated signal masses
% because the background events do not have a well-defined value for the ``truth scalar resonance mass'' and
% the `parameter' assigned to background events must be uninformative regarding the signal / background
% discrimination. This is achieved by randomly assigning a ``truth scalar resonance mass'' that follows the
% distribution seen in the signal training events. During implementation, the mass of the targeted signal
% is given, which results in optimal discrimination for that signal hypothesis. As the ideal neural network
% output (when trained on the binary cross entropy) is a monotonic function of the signal-to-background
% density ratio, this means that the PNN will optimally classify the targeted signal events, as specified by the
% physics input parameter.

%% Neural network (NN) and parameterised neural network (PNN)~\cite{Baldi:2016fzo} outputs applied to events passing the above selections are used to extract possible signals for the non-resonant and resonant search, respectively. During the training of the (P)NNs, the sum of all backgrounds weighted by their cross-sections are used in the $HH$ search, and the dominant $t\bar t$ background is used in LQ search. The PNN is parameterised in the mass of the heavy resonance (LQ) for the $HH$ (LQ) search, providing near-optimal sensitivity over the range of signal masses considered, and interpolates well between the mass points used for training.% The background does not have a well defined value of the heavy resonance or LQ mass, so during training the background events are assigned a random value from the signal parameter values. Maybe mention that NNs are optimal / sufficient statistic?. , where a single binary classifier is not optimal for all signal masses. without major loss of sensitivity, allowing results to be quoted for masses other than those used during training



More details on NN/PNN setting and training 
are described in section~\ref{sec:DiHiggs:MVAtraining} TODO: add reference to 
the MVA section. 
% The (P)NNs use rectified linear unit and sigmoidal activation functions 
% for the hidden and output layers, respectively, binary cross entropy as the loss function, 
% and stochastic (mini-batch) gradient descent as the optimiser~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. 
% % For the PNN used in the $\tau_\text{had}\tau_\text{had}$ category, 3 layers of 128 hidden nodes, 
% % followed by 1 hidden layer of 16 nodes are used. 
% For the (P)NN used in the $\tau_\text{lep}\tau_\text{had}$ SLT category, 
% 2 layers of 512 hidden nodes are used, 
% and for the (P)NN used in the $\tau_\text{lep}\tau_\text{had}$ LTT category 
% 3 layers of 512 (256) nodes are used. 
% The (P)NN input variables are standardised by subtracting

% Gradient boosting is used with a shrinkage of 0.2.% The PNN used in the $\tau_\text{had}\tau_\text{had}$ category has three hidden layers of 128 nodes followed by one of 16 nodes, and the $\tau_\text{lep}\tau_\text{had}$ (P)NNs have two hidden layers of 512 nodes in the SLT category, and three hidden layers of (256) 512 nodes in the LTT category.



\subsection{$Z+\text{HF}$ control region}
\label{sec:selection:zcr}

The normalisation of the $Z+\text{HF}$ background is determined 
from data by fitting the $m_{\ell\ell}$ distribution in the  a dedicated control region 
($Z+\text{HF}$ CR) in the likelihood fit. 
This is to account for a known discrepancy in the $Z+\text{HF}$ production
cross-section at NLO with respect to data, as provided for these processes in \textsc{Sherpa}. 
The $Z+\text{HF}$ CR targets events containing $Z$~boson decays to electron or muon pairs 
using triggers that require single leptons, or pairs of same-flavour leptons. 
Exactly two oppositely-charged same-flavour leptons and exactly two $b$-tagged jets are required 
to be reconstructed offline. The leptons are required to have \pt$>9~\text{GeV}$, 
pass offline \pt\ thresholds based on the trigger thesholds, 
be compatible with originating from the primary vertex, 
and pass medium identification and loose isolation requirements. 
Lastly, the invariant mass of the lepton pair is required to be between 75~\GeV\ 
and 110~\GeV\ to select events originating from a $Z$~boson decay, 
and $m_{bb}$ is required to be less than 40~\GeV\ or greater than 210~\GeV\ 
to ensure orthogonality to other analyses containing Higgs boson decays. 
This region also provides constraints on the normalisation of the $t\bar t$ background. 
% Figure~\ref{fig:zcr} shows the post-fit background and data $m_{\ell\ell}$ distributions 
% in the $Z+\text{HF}$ control region.
% Since the branching ratios of $Z$~bosons to electrons and muons are known accurately, 
% this production cross-section is determined simultaneously using $Z\to ee$ and $Z\to\mu\mu$ events. 
% These triggers have lower \pt $$ (\pt\) thresholds for electrons (muons) which vary with data-taking year. The corresponding offline trigger thresholds start at 25~GeV (21~GeV) for the single electron (muon) triggers, 13~GeV and 13~GeV (19~GeV and 10~GeV) for the leading and subleading lepton respectively for the di-electron (di-muon) triggers, and electron (muon) thresholds of 18~GeV (15~GeV) or 26~GeV (9~GeV) for the electron-plus-muon triggers.
